# Fusion MCP Gotchas

Failure modes from production sessions plus stress-test findings. Each entry: what happens, why, the fix.

## Lock-badge display lag on standalone script-built sketches (G9 corrected 2026-05-31)

A sketch that is built by a script AND is not immediately consumed by a downstream feature in the same script can be fully constrained AND have a working parametric link to user parameters, while its browser-tree icon shows NO lock badge until you enter edit mode once. After exiting edit mode the badge stays. `design.computeAll()` does NOT force the badge to update.

Sketches that ARE immediately consumed by an extrude / cut / revolve / etc. in the same script render their lock badge correctly right away. The feature creation appears to force the UI refresh. Verified in the claude-test mounting plate build, 2026-05-31: `plate_outline` (consumed by extrude) and `hole_outline` (consumed by cut) both showed lock badges immediately; the earlier standalone `claude_test_g9_*` lab sketches did not.

This is purely cosmetic. The constraint state was correct the whole time. The API flag (`Sketch.isFullyConstrained`) is honest. The geometry follows parameter changes correctly.

**What this gotcha replaces.** An earlier version of this entry claimed parameter-name expressions in sketch dims silently fail to constrain the geometry. That claim was wrong and was the result of taking the absent lock badge as evidence of constraint failure without testing parametric propagation. Parameter-name expressions in sketch dimensions do constrain geometry correctly; verify with a parametric round-trip rather than the browser-tree badge.

**How to verify a sketch is really constrained without entering edit mode:**

1. Check `Sketch.isFullyConstrained` — should be True.
2. If the sketch dim uses a parameter expression: change the parameter value programmatically, call `design.computeAll()`, then read the dim's `parameter.value`. If it tracks the parameter change, the parametric link is live. If it stays frozen, something is genuinely broken.
3. Browser-tree badge absence alone is not evidence of failure.

**Open question.** Whether `Sketch.activate()` (or equivalent) forces the badge to render without requiring the user to click in. Untested; would let a canonical sketch helper leave visibly-locked sketches behind.

**Rule.** Trust `isFullyConstrained` plus a parametric round-trip. Don't trust the badge for state, only for "user-visible-confirmation."

## Lock-badge advice from older sessions

A previous entry in this file said the lock badge is ground truth and `isFullyConstrained` can lie. We have NOT reproduced a case where `isFullyConstrained` returns True for an actually-broken sketch in current Fusion (May 2026 build). The cases the previous advice was rooted in may have been the same display-lag misobservation that the corrected G9 above documents. If you do hit a case where the API flag and the live parametric round-trip disagree, log it as a new gotcha with a reproducer.

In-canvas line colors are still a useful tell when you ARE in edit mode: black = driving + fully constrained, blue = driving + under-constrained, red = over-constrained / conflict. The small red "pencil tip" in the default sketch icon is NOT a constraint indicator.

## Sketch plane orientation surprises

**XY plane (safe default).** Sketch X maps to world X, sketch Y maps to world Y. Extrude in `+Z` direction goes up. No surprises.

**XZ plane.** Sketch X maps to world X. Sketch Y maps to NEGATIVE world Z. For Z-up geometry, negate all Y values in your vertex list. A typical symptom: a side-profile bracket drawn Y-flipped on first attempt, only caught by the bounding box because the iso-top-right screenshot still looked plausible.

**YZ plane (`yZConstructionPlane`).** Sketch X maps to NEGATIVE world Z (inverted). Sketch Y maps to POSITIVE world Y. Normal/extrude direction is world X. So "up" in the sketch is sketch X with an inverted sign relative to world Z, and the sketch's vertical axis is sketch X, not Y. To place a point at world Z=80, use sketch X = -80; for world Y=20, use sketch Y = +20.

Verified universal in current Fusion (build `4bca736941837d3e42bba21bb36b9891e34b2fce`, May 2026) across two independent documents with a `worldGeometry` repro: a sketch point at (0.5, 1.0) cm reads world (0, 10mm, -5mm). Re-confirm if plane behavior changes in a future build. (The original guess for this entry was wrong, caught by the Dell-bracket session.)

**Habit for any non-XY plane.** Before committing to a coordinate scheme, drop one test `sketchPoint` and read its `worldGeometry` to confirm the mapping. Five lines, saves a full re-orientation debug cycle. See patterns.md N8 for a constrained yZ-plane worked example.

**Rule.** Default to XY for top-down designs (trays, panels, anything that lays flat). XZ for side-profile parts (brackets, arms), remembering to negate Y. Avoid YZ unless extrusion along world X is specifically wanted.

## Self-intersecting polygon returns `profiles.count == 2`

A polygon where two edges cross internally (e.g. an 8-vertex Z-profile where edges V8 to V1 cross V5 to V6, producing a figure-8) is treated by Fusion as TWO closed profiles, not an error. The extrude succeeds and produces wrong geometry.

**Rule.** Always `assert sk.profiles.count == <expected>` immediately after `sk.isComputeDeferred = False`. Print the count if uncertain. Bail before extruding.

Profile count of 0 means the polygon did not close (vertex typo or float mismatch).

## Undo wipes whole-script transactions silently

`update(undo)` reverses the last `execute` as ONE atomic transaction. If that script added params AND created geometry, undo wipes both. Common symptom: "wait, why are these params missing?" several scripts later.

**Same rollback on exception-driven failure.** It is not only user undo. If a script throws partway (say, on `params.add` call 6 of 25), the 5 adds that already succeeded are silently wiped too. The tool error shows the traceback for the failing call but does NOT report which prior changes rolled back. Re-running an idempotent script after the fix then picks up from the last committed state, not the failed transaction's intermediate state.

**Rule.** Make every script idempotent (params, bodies, sketches all checked-and-added). When rollback is plausible, split into two `execute` calls: params first, geometry second. Prefer the delete-loop cleanup over undo when resetting geometry.

## `apiDocumentation` with null apiCategory returns empty silently

Omitting `apiCategory` returns `{"message": "API documentation query completed", "success": true}` with NO data. Looks like success.

**Rule.** Always set `apiCategory` to `"member"`, `"class"`, `"description"`, or `"all"`.

## Internal units are cm, not mm

`userParameters.itemByName(name).value` returns CM. `Point3D.create(x, y, z)` takes CM. A 30mm parameter has `.value == 3.0`.

`ValueInput.createByString('30 mm')` accepts unit suffixes and Fusion converts. Use this for human-readable expressions.

**Trap.** Treating `.value` as mm and multiplying sketch coords by 10 doubles every dimension.

**Rule.** Only multiply by 10 when PRINTING dimensions for human display. Math inside scripts stays in cm.

## Screenshot `direction: "current"` auto-fits in most cases, but not all

`direction: "current"` auto-fits the camera to show the body in the common case. It does NOT preserve the current viewport camera; it re-fits.

Two known failure modes:

- Untitled docs: auto-fit is unreliable, often returns an empty frame.
- Immediately after script-driven feature additions: the camera may not have settled, fit can miss.

**Rule.** Always run the explicit fit-view block (patterns.md section 20) before screenshotting. Treat `direction: "current"` auto-fit as a happy-path bonus, not a guarantee.

## Camera reset has no MCP primitive (CLOSED 2026-05-22)

Resolved via the Python API from within an `execute` script. The MCP itself doesn't expose a camera primitive directly, but Fusion's `activeViewport.fit()` does what's needed:

```python
vp = app.activeViewport
vp.fit()
cam = vp.camera
cam.viewOrientation = adsk.core.ViewOrientations.IsoTopRightViewOrientation
cam.isFitView = True
vp.camera = cam
vp.refresh()
```

See patterns.md section 20. Verified across multiple successive design iterations; produces consistent framing every time.

Previous workarounds (asking the user to press Home, or hoping `direction: "current"` happened to do the right thing) are no longer needed.

## Named-direction screenshots still need an explicit fit-view call

Closing the camera-reset gap (above) does NOT change the fact that named directions like `iso-top-right` don't auto-fit on their own. If you call `read` screenshot with a named direction WITHOUT first running the `vp.fit()` pattern from patterns.md section 20, the result is whatever zoom the viewport happened to be at, often a tight crop or empty frame.

**Rule.** For deterministic screenshots, ALWAYS run the patterns.md section 20 fit-view block first, then take the screenshot. Even for `direction: "current"`. Controlling the camera explicitly is more reliable than depending on screenshot-side auto-fit behavior.

## `setOneSideExtent` with fixed distance stops at obstructions

A counterbore cut using `setDistanceExtent(floor_thickness)` to cut up from a gusset bottom can stop short when the gusset itself sits below the sketch plane. The fixed distance only clears the upper feature, leaving the cut blocked.

**Rule.** When geometry below the sketch plane is variable or unknown depth, use `setAllExtent(direction)` for cut and intersect operations. Cuts through everything in that direction.

## Do not catch exceptions in `run()`

```python
# BAD
def run(_context: str):
    try:
        # ... work ...
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"failed: {e}")  # loses the traceback
```

The MCP returns Python exceptions with full traceback as the tool error. Catching them turns a 30-second fix into a 10-minute debug because the line number and stack frame are gone.

**Rule.** Let exceptions propagate. Trust the tool error path.

## Counterbore vs countersink direction

For parts where screws drive upward into the part (e.g. mounting brackets installed from below), the counterbore must be cut UP from the screw-tab bottom, not DOWN from the top. Easy to get wrong on the first attempt by defaulting to "screw enters from the top".

**Rule.** Trace the actual screw direction in the install before placing the counterbore. Place the counterbore sketch on a plane positioned at the bottom-facing side, then `setAllExtent(NegativeExtentDirection)` to cut up.

## Save on Untitled documents fails via MCP

Calling `execute document save` on a never-saved doc returns `{"error": "Document 'Untitled' is new and must be saved by the user first.", "success": false}`. No dialog, no UI prompt. Clean refusal.

**Rule.** Initial SaveAs must happen in the Fusion UI. After that, MCP `save` works for revisions. Surface this to the user when they ask Claude to save a brand-new design.

## Close on dirty documents requires confirmation flag

`execute document close` on a dirty doc returns: `"has unsaved changes. Confirm with the user before closing. Specify userConfirmedSaveAndClose or userConfirmedCloseWithoutSave in the request."`

Also: `userConfirmedSaveAndClose: true` on an Untitled doc still fails with the same "must be saved by the user first" error, because the save step inside save-and-close hits the same wall.

**Rule.** Never auto-pick which confirmation flag to send. Surface the choice to the user. The `saved: false` field in the close response is the audit trail for "did the agent discard changes?"

## Export path requirements

- Relative paths fail with `RuntimeError: 3 : The selected folder does not exist.`
- Protected paths (e.g. `C:/Windows/System32/`) fail with `RuntimeError: 3 : The selected folder is not accessible.`
- Missing parent folder likely produces the same "does not exist" error.
- Overwrite is SILENT. Existing file clobbered without prompt.

**Rule.** Always absolute paths. Always `os.makedirs(dirname, exist_ok=True)` before export. If preserving prior versions matters, add a suffix to the path.

## `createC3MFExportOptions` capital C

The 3MF export function is `em.createC3MFExportOptions`, not `em.create3MFExportOptions`. Common signature-guess miss. The C prefix is consistent with how Fusion versions its color-capable formats.

## ExportManager methods are `create*ExportOptions`, never `create*ExportInput` (2026-07-16)

Every other feature in the API uses the `createInput` naming convention, so `em.createSTLExportInput(...)` is the natural guess and it is wrong:

```
AttributeError: 'ExportManager' object has no attribute 'createSTLExportInput'.
Did you mean: 'createSTLExportOptions'?
```

The whole family is `Options`: `createSTLExportOptions`, `createC3MFExportOptions`, `createFusionArchiveExportOptions`, `createSTEPExportOptions`, `createOBJExportOptions`, `createIGESExportOptions`, `createSATExportOptions`, `createSMTExportOptions`, `createUSDExportOptions`, `createDXFFlatPatternExportOptions`, `createDXFSketchExportOptions`.

Two further traps:

- **The filename is a constructor arg, not a property.** `em.createSTLExportOptions(geometry, filename)`. There is no `.filename =` step for STL/3MF (unlike some older snippets).
- **Argument order flips for the Fusion archive.** It is `createFusionArchiveExportOptions(filename, component)` — filename FIRST — while STL/3MF are `(geometry, filename)`. Easy silent mix-up.

**Rule.** When unsure of an ExportManager signature, print the surface first; it is one cheap call and beats a failed round-trip:

```python
print([m for m in dir(design.exportManager) if 'Options' in m])
```

## Screenshot base64 can blow the tool-result token limit (2026-07-16)

`mcp__fusion__screenshot` returns base64 inline. At 1200px wide with `transparent=false` a single screenshot ran ~148,700 characters and was rejected/spilled to a file, costing a round-trip for nothing.

Also: `transparent=true` (the default) on a light-coloured body over a light background renders an image that reads as blank/washed out.

**Rule.** For anything above roughly 800px, or any repeated visual-check loop, skip the screenshot tool and write the file yourself, then read it back:

```python
vp = app.activeViewport
vp.fit(); vp.refresh(); adsk.doEvents()
vp.saveAsImageFile('C:/abs/path/shot.png', 1400, 780)
```

Then `Read` the PNG. Cheaper, higher resolution, no transparency surprise, and the file can be dropped straight into the part's `docs/` folder.

## `viewExtents` is in cm (internal units), like everything else (2026-07-16)

Setting `cam.viewExtents = 22.0` intending "22mm across" gives a 220mm-wide view, i.e. fully zoomed out. Same cm rule as all other geometry. For a ~32mm-tall view use `3.2`. Also set `cam.isFitView = False` before hand-placing `eye`/`target`, or the fit overrides your framing.

## Imported SVG curves are FIXED — `sketch.move()` silently does nothing (2026-07-16)

`sketch.importSVG(filename, x, y, scale)` brings geometry in as **fixed** sketch curves. Any later attempt to reposition them is a silent no-op:

```python
sk.importSVG(SVG, 0, 0, s)
# ... compute dx, dy to centre it ...
sk.move(coll, matrix)     # returns without error, moves NOTHING
```

No exception, no `False` return. The bounding box afterwards is byte-identical to before, which is the only tell.

**Rule.** Place at import time using the position args. The anchor is the SVG's **top-left**, and geometry extends **+X / -Y** from it. To centre a logo of final size `w` x `h` on a target point:

```python
s = target_w / native_w_at_scale_1
ax_cm = (target_cx - w/2) / 10.0
ay_cm = (target_cy + h/2) / 10.0
sk.importSVG(SVG, ax_cm, ay_cm, s)
```

Measure `native_w_at_scale_1` with a throwaway import at `scale=1.0` first; scaling is linear and aspect is preserved to ~0.1%.

## SVG holes come back as SEPARATE profiles — extruding all of them fills the logo in (2026-07-16)

After `importSVG`, counters and ring interiors are their own profiles. Extruding every profile turns letter counters solid and fills ring shapes: an "8" becomes a blob, an outlined circle becomes a disc.

Real example (a wordmark logo, 10 profiles): 1 five-loop graph mark, 1 three-loop glyph, 2 single-loop letters, and **6 hole profiles** (four glyph counters at 4.72 mm² each, two more at 2.32 and 3.15 mm²).

Fusion represents a region-with-holes as a profile whose `profileLoops.count > 1` (first loop `isOuter=True`, the rest `False`), and *also* emits each hole as its own single-loop profile.

**Rule.** Filter before extruding:

```python
thresh = 100.0 * s * s          # mm^2, scaled with the import; tune per asset
keep = adsk.core.ObjectCollection.create()
for i in range(sk.profiles.count):
    pr = sk.profiles.item(i)
    area = pr.areaProperties(
        adsk.fusion.CalculationAccuracy.LowCalculationAccuracy).area * 100.0
    if pr.profileLoops.count > 1 or area > thresh:
        keep.add(pr)
```

Keep multi-loop profiles unconditionally (they already carry their holes), plus single-loop profiles above an area threshold (the solid letters). Print the kept/dropped split and eyeball it once per new asset — the threshold is asset-specific, not universal.

## `importSVG` anchors to the viewBox origin, not the content bounds (2026-07-16)

Placement maths derived from the content bounding box will be off by however much padding sits between the viewBox origin and the artwork. Real case: horizontal placement was exact, vertical was **5.0mm out**, because the SVG's content did not start at the viewBox's top edge.

**Rule.** Never hand-derive the anchor. Two-pass it:

```python
# pass 1: probe at (0,0), measure what you actually get
pr = root.sketches.add(plane); pr.name = '_probe'
pr.importSVG(SVG, 0, 0, s)
u0, u1, v0, v1 = sk_bbox(pr)          # min/max of every sketchCurve bbox
pr.deleteMe()

# pass 2: shift by the measured delta (import x/y translate sketch coords 1:1)
du = target_u_min - u0
dv = target_v_min - v0
sk = root.sketches.add(plane)
sk.importSVG(SVG, du, dv, s)
```

The `(x, y)` args translate the import in sketch space exactly, so the delta from a probe is always correct regardless of internal padding.

## Sketch curve `boundingBox` is in SKETCH space, not world (2026-07-16)

`sketchCurve.boundingBox` returns coordinates in the sketch's own U/V frame with Z always 0. On an XY sketch at the origin the two frames coincide, so this goes unnoticed for a long time — then you put a sketch on an offset or rotated plane and every bounds assert is silently meaningless (a front-face sketch reported `Z 0.00..0.00` for geometry genuinely spanning Z 4..20).

**Rule.** Convert before asserting against world bounds:

```python
wp = sk.sketchToModelSpace(adsk.core.Point3D.create(u, v, 0))
```

To learn a plane's mapping, transform three points and diff them:

```python
a  = sk.sketchToModelSpace(P(0,0,0))
bU = sk.sketchToModelSpace(P(1,0,0))   # dU = bU - a -> world dir of sketch +U
bV = sk.sketchToModelSpace(P(0,1,0))   # dV = bV - a -> world dir of sketch +V
```

For an XZ-offset plane this returns `dU=(1,0,0)`, `dV=(0,0,-1)` — confirming sketch +V maps to world **-Z**.

## `ConstructionPlaneInput.setByPlane` throws in parametric mode (2026-07-16)

```
RuntimeError: 3 : Environment is not supported
```

`setByPlane(Plane3D)` — the obvious way to get a plane with explicit UV directions — is unavailable in a normal parametric Design. Use `setByOffset` from an origin plane and live with that plane's UV convention, or use `setByThreePoints`.

Consequence worth planning around: you cannot dial in the plane orientation to suit your artwork. Combined with imported SVG being fixed (unmovable, unmirrorable), an SVG on an XZ-derived plane WILL import upside down. The fix is to pre-flip the source file:

```xml
<svg width="576" height="160" viewBox="0 0 576 160" ...>
<g transform="translate(0,160) scale(1,-1)">  <!-- original content --> </g>
</svg>
```

The plane's flip then cancels the file's flip. Note the build now depends on that generated file, so keep it next to the design and document it.

## `participantBodies` wants a plain list, not an ObjectCollection (2026-07-16)

Every other collection-shaped API arg takes an `ObjectCollection`, so this is a natural mistake:

```python
ei.participantBodies = coll        # TypeError: argument 2 of type 'std::vector<...BRepBody>'
ei.participantBodies = [stand]     # correct
```

## An inset feature on a flat-printed part becomes an unsupported island (2026-07-16)

`OffsetStartDefinition` is the obvious tool for "set this feature back from the face". On a part that prints flat, it can silently destroy a support-free print.

Real case: a locating tab under a sculpture needed to be clear of the visible front face so the face stayed round. Centring it in the thickness (2mm clear of *both* faces) is the symmetric, better-looking answer — and it starts the tab at Z=2 with **nothing beneath it**. The part of the tab overhanging the body outline becomes a floating island 2mm above the plate. Fusion builds it happily; the slicer then demands support on a part whose whole selling point was no supports.

**Rule.** Before insetting a feature with `OffsetStartDefinition` on a flat-printed part, ask what is under it at the start Z. If the feature extends beyond the silhouette of whatever sits below, inset from ONE face only and leave it flush with the plate:

```python
# floating: needs support where the tab overhangs the body
ei.startExtent = adsk.fusion.OffsetStartDefinition.create(VI('tab_inset'))
ei.setDistanceExtent(False, VI('body_t - 2 * tab_inset'))

# grounded: starts at Z=0, still clear of the visible face
ei.setDistanceExtent(False, VI('body_t - tab_inset'))
```

Verify it really starts on the plate:

```python
assert abs(min(tab_face_z)) < 0.01, "feature lifted off the plate - would need support"
```

Aesthetic symmetry is worth less than a support-free print. Ask which face actually matters.

## Offsetting a feature moves the part in its mate (2026-07-16)

Follow-on from the above, and the kind of thing that only shows up on the printer. Once a tab is inset from one face, it is **no longer centred in the part's thickness**. A socket cut at the mating part's dead centre then parks the part `inset/2` proud of centre — geometrically fine, visibly wrong, and invisible in CAD unless you compute it.

**Rule.** When a locating feature is asymmetric in thickness, shift the socket by half the asymmetry and assert where the part lands:

```python
socket_cy = BASE_CY + tab_inset/2.0          # tab flush at back, inset at front
part_back  = socket_cy + (tab_t + clear)/2.0 - clear/2.0
part_front = part_back - body_t
assert abs((part_front + part_back)/2.0 - BASE_CY) < 0.2, "part sits off-centre in its mate"
```

## Isolate a sub-feature's extent with face bounding boxes (2026-07-16)

After a Join, the feature you added is no longer a separate body, so you cannot measure it directly. Filter the merged body's faces by a coordinate you know the feature occupies alone:

```python
tab_z = []
for f in body.faces:
    fb = f.boundingBox
    if fb.minPoint.y*10 < -69.5:          # only the tab lives below the circles
        tab_z += [fb.minPoint.z*10, fb.maxPoint.z*10]
print(f"tab Z {min(tab_z):.2f}..{max(tab_z):.2f}")
```

This is how you prove an inset actually happened, and that the feature still touches the plate. Body-level bounding boxes cannot tell you either.

## Generated build inputs belong with the design, not in a temp dir (2026-07-16)

If a build consumes a *derived* asset (a pre-flipped SVG, a converted mesh, a generated profile), that file is a build dependency, not a scratch artifact. Left in a temp directory it works all session and breaks silently on the next rebuild after cleanup.

**Rule.** Put generated inputs next to the design (`design/` alongside the CAD source), commit the generator script beside them with a header explaining *why* the derived file exists, and say in the README that the build consumes the derived file rather than the source.

## An emboss on a vertical face needs an explicit sign check (2026-07-16)

Extruding artwork on a face whose plane normal points *into* the solid engraves it instead of embossing it, with no error. Whether you need `icon_t` or `-icon_t` depends on the plane's normal, which for `setByOffset` planes is inherited, not chosen.

**Rule.** Assert the resulting bounds moved the way you intended:

```python
assert abs(body.boundingBox.minPoint.y*10 - (front_y - icon_t)) < 0.01, \
    "embossed INWARD - flip the extrude sign"
```

## Body count is the cheapest correctness check after a Join (2026-07-16)

A Join extrude whose profiles do not actually touch the target silently produces **extra free-floating bodies** instead of failing. This is how an SVG placed slightly off its host face announces itself: the overhanging letters simply become their own bodies.

**Rule.** After any Join that should merge, `assert root.bRepBodies.count == 1` (or whatever the expected count is). It catches mis-placement that a screenshot from the wrong angle will happily hide. Pair it with an explicit bounds assert when placing onto a known face:

```python
assert min(xs)*10 > face_x_min and max(xs)*10 < face_x_max, "artwork overruns host face"
```

## `isRollingBall = True` matters for fillets

Default `FilletFeatureInput` geometry is NOT the spherical-corner blend most CAD users expect. Set `isRollingBall = True` for the standard blend.

## `isComputeDeferred` matters for >10 vertex sketches

`sk.isComputeDeferred = True` before bulk `addByTwoPoints` calls, `= False` after. Without it, every line add re-solves the sketch. Below 10 vertices the difference is negligible; at 50+ Fusion freezes.

## HoleFeatureInput is worth using over sketch+cut

It is tempting to bypass `HoleFeatureInput` because the signature looks awkward, but it works on first attempt with `createCounterboreInput(holeDia, cboreDia, cboreDepth)` and `setPositionByPoint(face, point3d)`.

**Rule.** Use `HoleFeatures` for standard holes (simple, counterbore, countersink). Parametric, named, editable in timeline, cleaner than two extruded cuts. Reserve sketch+extrude-cut for non-standard hole geometry.

## Project ID format mismatch

`document/open` returns `parentProjectId` in base64 form (e.g. `a.YnVzaW5lc3M6Z21haWw...`). `document/recent`, `document/search`, and `projects` return the same project as a decimal ID (e.g. `202602051047590776`). Same project, two formats. Use whatever the consuming call accepts; not yet confirmed if `document/open` for fileId accepts either form.

## Flange overhangs need slicer tree supports

CAD-side note: 10mm+ horizontal flange overhangs require tree supports in the slicer. No CAD-side fix short of redesigning as a chamfered skirt. Worth flagging when proposing flanged designs.

## `defaultLengthUnits` is read-only via script

Display units (mm vs cm) must be set via the Fusion UI or document template, not via script. Internal geometry is always cm regardless of display units; this is cosmetic only.

## `setDistanceExtent` direction is implicit on HoleFeature

For `HoleFeatureInput.setDistanceExtent`, the through-direction comes from the face normal passed to `setPositionByPoint`. No explicit `ExtentDirections` argument needed. Different from `ExtrudeFeatureInput`, which requires explicit direction.

## Redo stack is consumed by new features

After `undo`, any new feature added via `execute` consumes the redo stack. Subsequent `redo` returns `{"error": "Nothing to redo", "canUndo": true, "canRedo": false, "success": false}`. Fails gracefully.

**Rule.** The skill can rely on `canUndo` and `canRedo` flags in the returned JSON for branching logic. Document that any new feature kills the redo stack.

## Untitled docs have no fileId

`document/open` (read) lists Untitled docs without an `id` field. Cannot pass them to `document/open` (execute) since fileId is required. Untitled doc workflows must start from creating fresh in the Fusion UI or saving the doc first.

## Document search treats `-` and `_` as equivalent

Query `My-Part` matches docs named `My_Part...`. Useful for fuzzy matching across naming conventions.

## `participantBodies` is required for cuts that target a specific body

When multiple bodies exist in a component and a cut should only affect one:

```python
cut_in.participantBodies = [body]
```

Without this, Fusion may pick the wrong body or apply the cut to all candidate bodies. Always set when more than one body is present. Also required for the Join extrude pattern (`patterns.md` section 23) so the lip flange joins onto the body rather than creating a new disconnected solid.

## CAD volume is NOT a filament-weight estimate, and the correction factor is not a constant (corrected 2026-07-31)

`body.volume` (returns cm^3) is the geometric solid volume. Printed mass is lower, because sparse infill leaves air inside anything thick enough to have an inside.

**The trap is not the first half of that sentence, it is assuming a fixed ratio.** Measured on two real parts:

| Part | Geometry | Printed mass as % of solid |
|---|---|---|
| 306 cm^3 tray, 30% infill | chunky, infill dominates | **~29%** |
| Fluted organizer shells, 3.2 mm walls | thin-walled, perimeters dominate | **68.2%** |
| Its inserts, 3.0 mm walls, large cavities | thin-walled, more room for infill | **59.7%** |

A 3.2 mm wall at ~0.42 mm line width is 7-8 perimeters, so it is **100% solid and the infill percentage never applies to it at all**. Only floors and thick plinth-like regions contain any infill. Carrying the 29% figure from a chunky part onto a thin-walled one underestimated filament by **2.1x** and would have set a price on a set that costs twice what was budgeted.

Note the last two rows are the same design: shells and inserts differed by 8.5 points. Predicting the inserts from the shell ratio still overshot by 14%.

**Rule.** Any pre-slice number is provisional, full stop. Do not scale CAD volume by a remembered ratio; slice the actual STL and read grams and time. If you must estimate before slicing, bound it: thin-walled parts approach solid density, chunky parts approach the infill fraction, and the answer is somewhere between.

**Two-tone costs more, not less**, and the cheap spool belongs on the heavy part. One colour per plate beats an AMS swap: a mid-print colour change purges more filament than a small part weighs, and per-plate printing reports `filament change times: 0` with no purge tower.

## `document/open` (execute) requires fileId in urn form

The `fileId` parameter for `execute document open` is the `urn:adsk.wipprod:dm.lineage:...` form returned in the `id` field of `document/search` or `document/recent` results.

**Workflow.** `read document search` (or `recent`) -> copy the `id` field -> pass as `fileId` to `execute document open`. Project ID is NOT a substitute and isn't required for the open call.

## Tapered cut needs the third arg form of `setOneSideExtent`

`setOneSideExtent(extentDef, direction)` is the standard signature. To add taper (countersink-style cone), pass a third `ValueInput` for the taper angle:

```python
ext_def = adsk.fusion.DistanceExtentDefinition.create(
    adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString('cs_depth'))
taper_vi = adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString('-cs_angle / 2')  # negative = inward
cut_in.setOneSideExtent(ext_def,
    adsk.fusion.ExtentDirections.NegativeExtentDirection,
    taper_vi)
```

Easy to miss the third positional arg. For standard countersinks, prefer `HoleFeatures.createCountersinkInput` (`patterns.md` section 25); it's parametric and editable in the timeline.

## STL refinement is a no-op for flat geometry, real for curves

`MeshRefinementLow`, `MeshRefinementMedium`, `MeshRefinementHigh` produce identical files for any flat-faceted geometry. The difference only shows up on curved surfaces (fillets, revolves, lofts), where High gives smoother facets at the cost of file size.

**Rule.** Default to `MeshRefinementHigh` for production exports. Cost on flat-dominated geometry is zero (identical output); benefit on curve-heavy parts is significant.

## Export artifact cleanup is your responsibility

The MCP writes export files wherever you point them, never warns on overwrite, and never cleans up. Test runs that wrote to `C:/temp/test_body.stl` etc. accumulate over sessions.

**Rule.** Use a scoped sub-folder for throwaway exports (e.g. `C:/temp/fusion-tests/`) that you can delete in bulk. Production exports should always go to a project-pathed destination, never `C:/temp`.

## Math-function names are reserved as user-parameter names

`floor` is not a valid user-parameter name; Fusion's expression language reserves it for the math function `floor(x)`. `params.add('floor', ...)` raises `RuntimeError: 3 : param name is not valid` with no indication of which name failed.

Likely also reserved (not exhaustively tested): `ceil`, `abs`, `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `atan2`, `log`, `ln`, `exp`, `min`, `max`, `pi`, `e`. Plain English words like `wall` are fine, so the rule is specifically Fusion expression-language identifiers, not arbitrary words.

**Rule.** Suffix any potentially-colliding name: `floor_thk`, `min_clearance`. Adopt a `<noun>_<adjective>` convention for thickness, depth, and length params (`wall_thk`, `body_height`).

## Stdout buffering can hide which loop iteration failed

When a script crashes mid-loop, prints from before the crash may not flush in time. Symptom: the log shows iterations 1-5 succeeding, iteration 6 has no log line, yet the traceback fires from inside iteration 6.

**Rule.** Use `print(name, flush=True)` for diagnostic prints when narrowing a failing iteration, or print AFTER each successful op so the last printed name is the last success and the failure is whatever came next in the input list.

## RectangularPattern with `isSymmetricInDirectionOne=True` makes wrong or disconnected bodies

Patterning a `JoinFeatureOperation` extrude (single knuckle at X=0) with `quantityOne=3`, `distanceOne='40 mm'`, `ExtentPatternDistanceType`, and `isSymmetricInDirectionOne=True` does NOT produce 3 instances at X=-20, 0, +20. It produces 6 new disconnected bRepBodies at X plus or minus 40 (body count went 2 to 8), and the Join did not merge. The result matches no standard interpretation of the inputs.

**Workaround.** Use `MirrorFeatures` (patterns.md N10, verified V7) for symmetric replication, or place instances manually on offset construction planes. Root cause unresolved but reproducible. Until investigated, prefer Mirror.

## SketchPoint is not hashable

`adsk.fusion.SketchPoint` cannot go in a `set()`. To find a corner, collect into a LIST and use `min(pts, key=lambda sp: (sp.geometry.x, sp.geometry.y))`. Applies to most Fusion API objects; prefer lists plus key functions over sets.

## Driving a joint does not persist through a recompute

Setting `jointMotion.rotationValue` / `slideValue` repositions the model, but adding a feature or any recompute (including setting `transform2` or `isGrounded`) resets driven joints to their rest position. Observed repeatedly: a lid driven to 180 degrees snapped back to 0 after new features were added and on every reorientation. Mitigations: set `restValue` on the joint limits (patterns.md N15); always re-drive joints as the final step before screenshot or export. Treat joint drive state as transient.

## Preview API badges are release gates

Symptom: a method exists in the scraped API corpus and works in a local experiment, but Autodesk later changes or removes it and the public plugin/server breaks.

Root cause: some Fusion API pages are explicitly tagged Preview and say not to deliver distributed programs that use preview capabilities.

Current corpus review, 2026-05-31:
- Stable May 2026 pages: `Component.findMeshUsingRay`, `MeshBody.calculateCollisionsWithRay`, `ConstructionPlaneInput.setByAngleOnCurvedFace`.
- Preview families: `UserCoordinateSystem*`, `ElectronManager` / Electronics objects, `AssemblyConstraint*`, `VolumetricModel*`.

**Rule.** Use Preview APIs only after explicit user opt-in. Do not put Preview APIs in default public workflows or stable MCP tools.

## Print-in-place at tight clearances can fuse on FDM (CAD-side print note)

PRINTER-VERIFIED on a captured slider+hinge test part: a print-in-place slider plus hinge at 0.2mm rotational / 0.3mm Z / 1mm Y clearances FUSED on the first Bambu print (moving parts welded to the housing). For this class of part, prefer SEPARATE parts laid out on one plate with assembly clearances (looser, tunable, sandable) over a captured print-in-place mechanism, and use a separate printed or filament/rod pin through the hinge knuckles rather than a print-in-place knuckle. See patterns.md N11, N17, N44, and N45 for the parametric clearance technique, the separate-parts recommendation, and full hinge recipes.

IF you do commit to a print-in-place hinge, keep its axis HORIZONTAL / parallel to the build plate so the knuckle-separation gaps print as vertical seams (reliably free). Laying the part so the hinge axis is VERTICAL turns those gaps into horizontal layer planes that fuse easily, giving a stiff or welded pivot. Same family as the "flange overhangs need slicer tree supports" note above.

### PRINTER-VERIFIED: keyed tab into a socket, PLA

Our own two-print result, so this one is not a tutorial recipe.

| Fit | Tab | Socket | Total clearance | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tab in socket, display stand | 8 x 6 mm rectangular | 8.3 x 6.3 | **0.3 mm** | seats, but "very tight" |
| same | 8 x 6 mm | 8.4 x 6.4 | **0.4 mm** | "works great, fitment is much better" |

PLA on a Bambu P1S, printed flat, socket opening upward. 0.4mm total (0.2/side) is a friction fit that still holds a display piece upright without wobble. That matches the usual FDM bands: **0.2-0.4mm total for a snug/friction fit, ~0.5mm+ before it slides freely.** Start at 0.4 rather than 0.3 for this class of fit.

Clearance is **absolute, not proportional**: it does not scale with the part. But engagement *length* does, and a longer tab has more surface to bind, so the same 0.4mm is effectively tighter on a 14mm tab than on an 8mm one. When scaling a design up, hold clearance and expect it to feel tighter, not looser.

### A fit validated on your own printer is not validated

This is the trap behind every clearance number above, and it is a judgement error rather than a CAD one.

If the model is going to a marketplace (MakerWorld, Printables, Thingiverse), strangers print it on machines you do not control. FDM tolerance varies by roughly **±0.1-0.2mm** between printers, nozzles, filaments, and slicer profiles; elephant foot alone eats that much. So:

- **"Very tight but it fits" on the designer's own printer is "does not go together" on a printer running slightly wide.** That is a support thread, not a print.
- The designer's printer is the *best* case, not the average case. It is the machine the part was iterated on.

Loosen toward the middle of the functional band before publishing, not to the edge that happens to work for you. The cost is asymmetric: a fit 0.1mm looser than ideal is slightly less crisp, while a fit 0.1mm tighter than someone's tolerance is unusable.

Counter-check before loosening: confirm the loose end still works. Going from a tight-but-functional fit to a wobbly one is a real regression, and on a display piece it is worse than the tight fit you started with. Reprint and confirm rather than assuming more clearance is free.

### Clearance recipes from accepted tutorial sources (NOT printer-verified by us)

Recipes recorded so a future first print has a baseline. None of the values below are validated by our own prints; expect to tune for your printer + slicer + material. See patterns.md N44 / N45 for full geometry recipes.

| Source | Mechanism | Per-face clearance | Diametric clearance | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| What-Make-Art print-in-place | Captive cone + cylinder, one body | -0.3 mm flat faces, -0.2 mm cone face | n/a (mating faces are flat + cone, not cylindrical) | Cone -35deg taper, 55deg overhang on lead-in walls, 0.8 mm fillet on non-bed edges, 0.8 mm chamfer on bed face |
| Snap-hinge | Two separate flanges with nub-in-cavity | n/a (cavity uses Offset Face) | 0.8 mm starting, range 0.2-0.8 mm | Nub taper -10 to -14 deg, 1 mm fillet on nub edge, 0.6 mm Offset Start clearance between mating flanges, 0.1 mm layer height |

Apply Offset Face to all opposing cavity walls SIMULTANEOUSLY with one negative value: the offset applies per-face, so -0.4 mm on opposite cavity walls produces 0.8 mm diametric clearance (standard snap-fit technique). The number you type into Offset Face is HALF the resulting diametric gap.

Two distinct philosophies are visible in these sources:
- What-Make-Art treats the cone face as the running surface (tight clearance there for less play) and the flat side faces as the support surfaces (looser clearance for free movement).
- The reference build uses no cone; the cylindrical nub rides in a cylindrical cavity with the cavity over-cut by Offset Face for free running, and a sketch-level taper on the nub (-10 to -14deg) to ease engagement.

Neither source distinguishes by material. PLA, PETG, and ABS will produce different functional clearances at identical CAD dimensions because of layer-line surface roughness and shrinkage. Treat the tabulated values as PLA-on-FDM starting points.

## G10 Stale feature reference after sketch geometry rewrite (2026-05-31)

A script that deletes all curves + dimensions in a sketch and replaces them with new geometry leaves any downstream feature (extrude, cut, fillet, etc.) pointing at a stale profile reference. Symptoms:

- `feature.healthState == 1` with `errorOrWarningMessage` containing "The profile reference is lost and this feature is using cached geometry."
- API queries on the body's edges show the NEW geometry (Fusion's cached output from the last successful compute).
- The Fusion UI continues to display the OLD geometry — the cached BREP rendered as-is.
- `design.computeAll()` does not fix this.

User-visible result: "I don't see any changes" despite the script reporting success and the BREP showing the new geometry.

**Fix.** Don't try to re-bind the feature in place. Delete it and re-create it with a fresh profile reference:

```python
old = body_comp.features.itemByName("dispense_hole_cut")
if old and old.healthState != 0:
    old.deleteMe()
sk = body_comp.sketches.itemByName("dispense_hole")
prof = sk.profiles.item(0)
ext = body_comp.features.extrudeFeatures
einput = ext.createInput(prof, adsk.fusion.FeatureOperations.CutFeatureOperation)
einput.startExtent = adsk.fusion.OffsetStartDefinition.create(
    adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString("slot_chamber_d + slot_narrow_d"))
einput.setDistanceExtent(False, adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString(
    "floor_thk - slot_chamber_d - slot_narrow_d"))
einput.participantBodies = [body_comp.bRepBodies.itemByName("body_main")]
new_feat = ext.add(einput)
new_feat.name = "dispense_hole_cut"
```

**Detection.** After any tool that mutates sketch geometry, audit every downstream feature's health:

```python
for ft in comp.features:
    if ft.healthState != 0:
        print(f"BROKEN {ft.name}: {ft.errorOrWarningMessage[:120]}")
```

Run this audit after every mutating call, not just at the end of a build. A feature that breaks mid-timeline stays broken and silently corrupts everything downstream of it. The `audit_feature_health` tool does exactly this sweep.

## G11 Fillets break when upstream geometry edits move their edges (2026-05-31)

Constant-radius fillets store topological references to the edges they target. Small tweaks survive, but bumping a sketch dimension that moves an edge significantly (10mm+ along its length, or changes its orientation) often pushes the fillet to `healthState == 2` or `3`:

```
The fillet/chamfer could not be created at the requested size.
This might be occurring at the ends of the selected edges.
```

1mm and 2mm fillets fail most often because they can't shrink to fit the new corner geometry. Larger named fillets on stable edges (body outer-corner rounding, cavity interior corners) typically survive.

**Reproduced in a real design session (2026-05-31).** Two sketch-dim edits broke three fillets across the same body:

| Edit (clip_profile sketch) | Broken fillet | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `d278: 65→80mm` (clip top extended +15mm) | `Fillet3` (state=2) | Targeted clip-top corner edge that no longer existed in same form |
| `d288: 28→43mm` (platform underside Z=60→75) | `Fillet4` (state=3) | Targeted edge whose Z range shifted |

**Fix.** SUPPRESS, don't delete. Lets the user re-enable or repair interactively, and signals the feature was lost but not abandoned.

```python
ft = body_comp.features.itemByName("Fillet3")
if ft and ft.healthState != 0:
    ft.isSuppressed = True
    design.computeAll()
```

**Don't try to auto-repair fillet edge references from a script.** Edge identity after BREP regeneration is unstable; re-selecting "the same" edge requires a geometric query (find an edge whose endpoints match the previous ones at a tolerance), which is error-prone and design-specific. Cheaper to surface the breakage to the user and ask them whether the missing fillet matters.

**Detection.** Same health-audit sweep as G10. Always run it after any edit that touches body sketches or extrude depths.

## G12 Re-binding the timeline marker forces full re-render (2026-05-31)

When the Fusion UI is showing a stale cached state (often after G10/G11 fixes), a hard repaint can be forced by rolling the timeline marker to position 0 and back to the end:

```python
tl = design.timeline
end = tl.count
tl.markerPosition = 0
tl.markerPosition = end
app.activeViewport.refresh()
```

`computeAll()` re-evaluates features in place but does not always trigger a full UI re-rasterize. The marker round-trip does. Use sparingly — it's a noticeable user-visible flash and re-evaluates the entire feature tree. Save and reopen is the bigger hammer if even this doesn't work.

## SketchText cannot be mirrored, and rotating it 180 degrees mirrors it instead

Same family as the fixed-imported-SVG problem, and it bites in the same place: a sketch plane whose +V maps to world -Z (any plane derived from XZ). Text drawn upright in sketch UV comes out upside down in the world.

For imported SVG the fix is a pre-flipped file (`<g transform="translate(0,H) scale(1,-1)">`). **That fix does not transfer to text.** `SketchText` is not a file you can pre-process, and it cannot be mirrored after creation any more than fixed SVG curves can.

The trap is the obvious workaround. Rotating the text 180 degrees (the last arg of `setAsMultiLine`) looks like it should cancel the flip. It does not:

- a 180 degree rotation flips **both** U and V
- the plane flips **only** V
- net effect: U is flipped alone, so the text is upright but **mirrored**

Mirrored bold text at a glance in a small render reads as correct. This will ship if you do not look at a real screenshot of that face.

The fix that works: **do not sketch on the flipped plane at all.** Build the text on the XY plane where the orientation is unambiguous, extrude as a NewBody, then move the body into place with a rotation.

```python
ei = exts.createInput(st, adsk.fusion.FeatureOperations.NewBodyFeatureOperation)
ei.setDistanceExtent(False, adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString('0.7 mm'))
ex = exts.add(ei)
tools = adsk.core.ObjectCollection.create()
for i in range(ex.bodies.count):
    tools.add(ex.bodies.item(i))          # one body per letter

# +90deg about X: (x,y,z) -> (x,-z,y).
# sketch +Y -> world +Z (upright); extrude +Z -> world -Y (out the front face).
m = adsk.core.Matrix3D.create()
m.setToRotation(math.pi/2.0, adsk.core.Vector3D.create(1, 0, 0),
                adsk.core.Point3D.create(0, 0, 0))
m.translation = adsk.core.Vector3D.create(cx_cm, face_y_cm, cz_cm)  # applied AFTER the rotation
mi = root.features.moveFeatures.createInput2(tools)
mi.defineAsFreeMove(m)
root.features.moveFeatures.add(mi)

ci = root.features.combineFeatures.createInput(target_body, tools)
ci.operation = adsk.fusion.FeatureOperations.JoinFeatureOperation
root.features.combineFeatures.add(ci)
```

Two details that matter:

- **Extrude 0.1mm deeper than the emboss you want and bury that 0.1 in the target.** Landing the tool body exactly coplanar with the target face asks Combine to join on coincident faces; overlap is more robust. Extrude 0.7 for a 0.6mm proud emboss, translate so the back sits 0.1mm inside.
- **Assert the proud height** (`body.boundingBox.minPoint.y == face_y - 0.6`). It catches a sign error on the translation, which otherwise buries the text invisibly inside the part.

Multi-line text produces **one body per letter**. Collect them all into the ObjectCollection or you will move some letters and leave the rest behind.

## `adsk.doEvents()` returns before a parameter change finishes recomputing

Setting `param.expression` then immediately reading `root.bRepBodies.count` (or a volume, or a bounding box) can return **mid-recompute state**. Observed: an assertion read `bodies=13` (11 letters + sculpture + base) right after a `body_t` change, on a design whose join was perfectly healthy. Re-querying the same doc a moment later returned `bodies=2`. Nothing was wrong with the model; the read was just early.

This wastes real time, because the failure looks exactly like a genuine broken join and sends you diagnosing the wrong thing.

`adsk.doEvents()` alone is not a barrier. Force the compute and settle:

```python
def settle(design, root, expected_bodies):
    for _ in range(8):
        design.computeAll()
        adsk.doEvents()
        if root.bRepBodies.count == expected_bodies:
            return True
    return False

bt.expression = '10 mm'
assert settle(design, root, 2), f"did not settle: bodies={root.bRepBodies.count}"
```

Only assert on geometry **after** it settles. If it never settles, the failure is real.

## Suppress hard-won features, do not delete them

When a design carries mutually exclusive variants (two logos on one face, two mount styles), the instinct is delete-and-rebuild per variant. Use `feature.isSuppressed = True` instead when the feature's *placement maths* was expensive to derive: two-pass SVG anchor probes, plane-flip cancellation, a rotation matrix onto a non-trivial face.

```python
feats = {f.name: f for f in root.features}
feats['base_logo_extrude'].isSuppressed = (variant != 'logo')
feats['base_text_join'].isSuppressed  = (variant != 'text')
```

Delete-and-rebuild means re-deriving that maths on every switch, and every re-derivation is a fresh chance to get it wrong. Suppression is reversible, survives the save, and keeps the timeline as documentation of both variants. Reserve deletion for geometry that is genuinely cheap to reconstruct from a few numbers.

Caveat: suppression is per-feature, so suppress the **whole chain** for a variant (sketch extrude + move + combine), not just its last feature.

## A parameter change that does not move the volume means the geometry did not move

This is the detection rule for script-driven (as opposed to constraint-driven) geometry, and it is worth stating as a standalone check because the bug is silent in every other channel.

When plan geometry is computed numerically in a build script, changing a user parameter updates the parameter and **nothing else**. The parameter table cheerfully reports the new value. Screenshots look plausible. Exports succeed. The only tell is that the volume does not move.

Seen twice on the same design:

1. `base_slot_w` reported 15.40mm while the slot stayed 10.4mm.
2. A base exported with a volume **identical** at two different thicknesses (64,763.3 both), because the tab sockets never widened. That reached an exported STL.

So, after any parameter change that should alter geometry:

```python
before = body.volume * 1000
p.expression = '15 mm'
settle(design, root, 2)
after = body.volume * 1000
assert abs(after - before) > 1.0, f"volume unchanged ({after:.1f}) -> geometry is not parametric here"
```

Two identical volumes across two parameter values is never a coincidence worth accepting. Rebuild the sketch at the new value.

## `importSVG` scale depends on the SVG's units, and unitless means px at 96 DPI

`importSVG(file, x, y, scale)` has no fixed unit contract. What `scale` means depends on how the SVG declares its own size:

- SVG whose `width`/`height` map to mm: `scale = target_mm / native_units` lands exactly.
- SVG with **unitless** `width="1275"`: Fusion reads those as **CSS pixels at 96 DPI**, so the same formula comes out **25.4/96 = 0.2646x too small**.

Observed on one machine, same session, two files: an artwork whose units were mm imported at exactly the requested 44.00mm, while a generated `width="1275"` file asked for 72.8mm and delivered **19.17mm**. The ratio is 3.7795 = 96/25.4, which is the tell. If your import comes back 3.78x small (or 3.78x large), this is why.

Do not hand-derive the scale. **Probe it:**

```python
s = (target_mm / art_units) * (96.0 / 25.4)   # only if the file is unitless
pr = root.sketches.add(plane)
pr.importSVG(SVG, 0, 0, s)
w = (bbox_of(pr)[1] - bbox_of(pr)[0]) * 10
pr.deleteMe()
assert abs(w - target_mm) < 0.5, f"scale wrong: got {w:.2f}"
```

Better: always probe-import, measure, and correct by the measured ratio (`s2 = s * target / measured`). That is unit-agnostic and survives whatever the next file declares. You need a probe pass anyway, because `importSVG` also anchors to the viewBox origin rather than the content bounds.

## Do not filter SVG counters by area; pair them to their parent by containment

The tempting filter for "which imported profiles are letter counters" is a size threshold: keep profiles with `profileLoops.count > 1` or `area > threshold`, drop the rest. It works only when every counter happens to be smaller than every real shape. **That is a property of one particular logo, not a rule.**

Counter-example from a real hand-lettered wordmark: a counter of **32.44 mm²** whose parent ring was **59.65 mm²**, on the same artwork as legitimate ink parts of **13.83** and **21.63 mm²**. Any threshold that dropped the counter also dropped real letters, and any threshold that kept the letters also filled the counter.

Pair each counter to the profile that owns it:

```python
info = []
for i in range(sk.profiles.count):
    p = sk.profiles.item(i); bb = p.boundingBox
    info.append(dict(i=i, p=p, loops=p.profileLoops.count,
                     x0=bb.minPoint.x*10, x1=bb.maxPoint.x*10,
                     y0=bb.minPoint.y*10, y1=bb.maxPoint.y*10))

def inside(a, b, m=0.01):
    return (a['x0'] > b['x0']+m and a['x1'] < b['x1']-m and
            a['y0'] > b['y0']+m and a['y1'] < b['y1']-m)

counters = set()
for par in [d for d in info if d['loops'] > 1]:
    cand = [d for d in info if d['loops'] == 1 and inside(d, par)]
    assert len(cand) == 1, f"ambiguous: {len(cand)} candidates"
    counters.add(cand[0]['i'])
```

**Verify by volume, not by eye.** Extrude the kept profiles and check the volume delta equals `kept_area * icon_t` exactly. If a counter got filled, the delta comes out high by that counter's area. On one build the emboss added 1,073.1 mm³ against a kept area of 1,073.13 mm² at 1.0mm: proof to the decimal that no counter was filled.

### The bbox version false-positives as soon as shapes overlap

Bounding-box containment is a proxy for real containment and it breaks when two drawn shapes overlap: the overlap sliver's bbox can sit entirely inside a neighbour's bbox and read as a hole.

Hit on a clapperboard glyph where a tilted stick overlapped a slate: the test found **4 holes when 3 were drawn**. Nothing was wrong with the geometry; the test was wrong.

When you drew the detail yourself, **match centroids to the coordinates you drew** instead. It is exact and cannot be fooled by overlap:

```python
want = [(cx + slot(lx)[0], cy + slot(lx)[1]) for lx in SLOT_XS]
holes = {i for i in range(sk.profiles.count)
         if min(math.hypot(cen(i).x*10-wx, cen(i).y*10-wy) for wx, wy in want) < 0.4}
assert len(holes) == len(want)
```

Print the distances. A clean match shows an obvious gap (observed: slots at 0.000-0.071mm, nearest non-slot at 0.726mm). If that gap is not obvious, the match is not safe.

## A cut from the wrong face has the SAME volume as a cut from the right one

The volume-diff rule catches geometry that did not move. It cannot catch geometry that moved to the wrong place, and pocket direction is the case that bites.

Extruding a pocket sketch from the XY plane at Z=0 with a positive distance cuts **upward from the bottom face**. If you wanted the pocket to open at the top, you get a void buried against the build plate, a solid top face, and **exactly the same volume**, because the same amount of material is removed either way.

Symptoms: the render looks solid from above, the part prints with holes face-down on the plate, and nothing mates. Volume, mass, and bounding box all agree with the correct part.

Cut downward from a plane at the top instead:

```python
pi = root.constructionPlanes.createInput()
pi.setByOffset(root.xYConstructionPlane, adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString('base_h'))
top = root.constructionPlanes.add(pi); top.name = 'base_top_plane'
sk = root.sketches.add(top)
...
ei.setDistanceExtent(False, adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString('-socket_d'))   # negative
```

Assert on the **face position**, which is the only signal that differs:

```python
floors = [round(f.boundingBox.minPoint.z*10, 2) for f in faces_matching(body, sock_y)]
assert abs(floors[0] - (BASE_H - SOCKET_D)) < 0.05, f"socket opens the wrong way: {floors}"
```

Generalises: for any feature where a sign error still removes the same material (pockets, counterbores, recesses), verify **where a face landed**, never the volume.

## An exception rolls back the entire `execute`, including geometry that succeeded

The tool runs each `execute` as one transaction. A traceback anywhere discards **everything the script built**, not just the failing step.

Cost a full rebuild once: a script created 6 bodies correctly, then threw `AttributeError` in the *reporting* code at the very end (`BoundingBox3D.combine` returns a bool and mutates in place, so `tot = tot.combine(bb) or tot` blows up). The geometry was perfect. The next call reported `bodies=0`.

So:

- Keep verification/printing trivially safe, or put it in a **separate** `execute` after the build lands.
- Make build scripts **idempotent** (delete-by-name at the top) so a rerun after a rollback is free.
- This is not a reason to `try/except` around `run()`. Swallowing the traceback loses the diagnosis and still rolls back. Fix the reporting bug.


## Restarting Fusion invalidates the MCP session; the client 404s until it reconnects

Symptom: every MCP call fails with `Client error '404 Not Found' for url 'http://127.0.0.1:27182/mcp'`, while Fusion is plainly running and healthy.

This looks exactly like "the MCP server is off", and the instinct is to go toggle **Preferences > General > API > Fusion MCP Server**. That is the wrong fix and it makes things worse: each restart mints a new server that invalidates the session again.

What is actually happening: MCP's streamable-HTTP transport is **session-based**. The client holds an `Mcp-Session-Id` from its first handshake. Restart Fusion and the new server has never heard of that id, so it answers `404` to every POST. The transport is behaving correctly; the client is talking to a server that does not know it.

Distinguish the two cases from outside the client, because they look identical from inside it:

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:27182/mcp
  -> 404   the route does not exist. The MCP server really is off. Enable it in Preferences.
  -> 405   Method Not Allowed. The route EXISTS and only accepts POST. The server is UP;
           your session is stale.
```

Confirm with a fresh handshake, which is unaffected by the dead session:

```powershell
$body = '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"probe","version":"1"}}}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:27182/mcp" -Method POST -Body $body `
  -ContentType "application/json" -Headers @{ "Accept" = "application/json, text/event-stream" }
```

A `200` plus an `Mcp-Session-Id` header proves the server is fine and the problem is entirely on the client side.

**The fix is to reconnect the client**, not to restart Fusion: in Claude Code, `/mcp` and reconnect the `fusion` server (or restart Claude Code). Only the user can do this; there is no tool call that re-handshakes your own transport.

Also check `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 27182` and confirm the owning PID is `Fusion360`. If something else holds the port, that is a genuinely different problem.

## Joint limits do not live on the JointMotion (2026-07-18)

`jointMotion.minimumValue` / `minimumValueEnabled` do not exist. Setting them appears to work in a script (Python happily assigns new attributes to some wrapped objects) and then has no effect.

Limits live on a `JointLimits` object hanging off the motion, and which one depends on the motion type:

| Motion | Limits property |
|---|---|
| `RevoluteJointMotion` | `rotationLimits` |
| `SliderJointMotion` | `slideLimits` |
| `CylindricalJointMotion` | both; pick `rotationLimits` unless you specifically want travel |
| `RigidJointMotion` | neither |

Each `JointLimits` exposes `isMinimumValueEnabled` / `minimumValue`, `isMaximumValueEnabled` / `maximumValue`, `isRestValueEnabled` / `restValue`. Note the `is` prefix, which is the part most people get wrong after reading older samples.

**Values are internal units**: radians for rotation, cm for slide. And you cannot get there via `ValueInput`:

```python
adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString("45 deg").realValue
# RuntimeError: Value does not contain a real
```

`realValue` is only meaningful on a `ValueInput` built with `createByReal`. A string-created one carries no evaluated number until a feature consumes it. Evaluate the expression yourself instead:

```python
um = design.unitsManager
lim = jm.rotationLimits                       # or jm.slideLimits
lim.isMaximumValueEnabled = True
lim.maximumValue = um.evaluateExpression("45 deg", "deg")   # returns radians
```

Pass `"deg"` for rotary and `"mm"` for linear as the expected measure; `evaluateExpression` returns the value in Fusion's internal unit for that measure, which is exactly what the limit wants. Read the value back afterwards to confirm it stored, because a limit that conflicts with the joint's current position can be quietly clamped.

## Fusion silently ignores a joint drive beyond its limits (2026-07-18)

Driving a joint past an enabled limit raises nothing, returns nothing, and leaves the joint where it was:

```python
lim.maximumValue = um.evaluateExpression("45 deg", "deg")
jm.rotationValue = um.evaluateExpression("90 deg", "deg")   # no exception
# jm.rotationValue is still whatever it was; the component did not move
```

There is no error and no warning. A script that assumes assignment means motion will report success on a model that never moved.

**Always read the value back** and compare against the request, and treat "assigned but unchanged" as a distinct outcome from "assigned and applied". Verify with geometry rather than the attribute alone when it matters: a 30 degree drive that lands moves the component's bounding box, and a 90 degree drive against a 45 degree limit leaves it identical.

## Ball joints only accept pitch=Z, yaw=X (2026-07-18)

`setAsBallJointMotion(pitchDirection, yawDirection)` looks like it takes any two principal axes. It does not. All nine principal-axis combinations were tested live on 2704.1.23 and exactly one is accepted:

```python
joint_input.setAsBallJointMotion(
    adsk.fusion.JointDirections.ZAxisJointDirection,   # pitch
    adsk.fusion.JointDirections.XAxisJointDirection,   # yaw
)
```

Every other pairing raises `Invalid parameter pitchDirection` or `Invalid parameter yawDirection`, including the intuitive `(X, Y)`. Hardcode the accepted pair; do not expose pitch and yaw as caller-controlled arguments, because eight of nine values are dead.

## Creating components from bodies: the API, and the rename it does (2026-07-18)

`Features.createComponentFromBodyFeatures` does not exist. Neither does a `CreateComponentFromBodyFeatureInput`. Samples referencing them are stale.

The working API is a method on the body:

```python
new_body = body.createComponent()          # world position preserved
new_body.parentComponent.name = "hinge_arm"
```

**The trap is what it does to the body name.** `createComponent()` moves the body into the new component and renames it to that component's default (`"Body1"`), discarding whatever you called it. Any later lookup by the original name silently fails, and in a multi-body script that shows up much later as a confusing `body_not_found`.

Restore it immediately:

```python
new_body = body.createComponent()
new_body.parentComponent.name = comp_name
new_body.name = original_name              # createComponent() clobbered this
```

## Moving an occurrence: rollTo and snapshots both revert the move (2026-07-18)

A move that assigns `occ.transform2` and then commits can end up as a perfect silent no-op: no exception, the API reports success, and the component has not moved. Two independent causes, and they stack.

**Rolling the timeline reverts the pending transform.** Calling `occ.timelineObject.rollTo(False)` before committing discards the assignment you just made. On a jointed component it is worse: the subsequent `design.snapshots.add()` raises `Has no pending snapshot`, because the roll consumed it. Do not roll.

**Ground-to-parent snaps the occurrence back.** Occurrences created by `createComponent()` default to `isGroundToParent = True`. `snapshots.add()` returns a ground-to-parent occurrence to its grounded position, silently undoing the move. Break the ground first:

```python
if getattr(occ, 'isGroundToParent', False):
    occ.isGroundToParent = False

before = occ.transform2.translation
m = occ.transform2
m.transformBy(matrix)
occ.transform2 = m
design.snapshots.add()
after = occ.transform2.translation          # verify, do not assume
```

**Always read the position back.** Beyond these two causes, a joint solver can legitimately override the requested move, so the only honest report is a before/after comparison rather than "the assignment did not raise".

## RigidGroups and ContactSets have no createInput (2026-07-18)

Both break the `createInput()` then `add(input)` pattern that most of the feature API follows.

```python
# Rigid group: add() takes the collection directly.
root.rigidGroups.add(occurrences, True)      # (occurrences, includeChildren)

# Contact sets live on the DESIGN, not the component.
design.contactSets.add(bodies)               # Component.contactSets does not exist
```

`RigidGroups.add` raises when an existing joint would make the group over-constrained, so wrap it rather than assuming a valid occurrence list succeeds.

**Contact sets additionally require assembly-context bodies.** The API wants bodies "in the context of the root component". A plain recursive walk over `component.bRepBodies` returns *native* bodies, which are rejected. For anything inside a component you need the proxy from the occurrence:

```python
for i in range(root.occurrences.count):
    occ = root.occurrences.item(i)
    for j in range(occ.bRepBodies.count):    # proxies, not occ.component.bRepBodies
        b = occ.bRepBodies.item(j)
```

This native-versus-proxy distinction is a general assembly-scripting trap, not specific to contact sets. `occ.bRepBodies` gives assembly-context proxies; `occ.component.bRepBodies` gives natives in component space.

## Shell has no direction enum, and a closed shell still needs the body (2026-07-18)

`adsk.fusion.ThicknessDirections` does not exist. There is no direction parameter on `ShellFeatureInput`. Direction is expressed purely by which of two independent properties you set:

| Intent | Set |
|---|---|
| Inward (the common case) | `insideThickness` |
| Outward | `outsideThickness` |
| Both | both, independently |

Setting `insideThickness` while intending "outside" is a silent wrong result, not an error: you get a shell of the right wall thickness growing the wrong way.

**A closed shell (hollow, no opening) still needs the body in the input collection.** An empty collection is rejected by `ShellFeatures.add`. Pass faces to remove for an open shell, or the body itself for a closed one.

Verify with volume, which is exact and unambiguous. For a 20x20x20 mm cube: open-top with 2 mm inside walls is 1952 mm3; fully closed with 2 mm outside walls is 4064 mm3.

## Chamfer's createInput2 takes no arguments (2026-07-18)

The chamfer API changed shape. `createInput2()` now takes no arguments at all, and edge sets are added through a `chamferEdgeSets` collection:

```python
chm_in = root.features.chamferFeatures.createInput2()          # no args
chm_in.chamferEdgeSets.addEqualDistanceChamferEdgeSet(
    edges, adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString("1 mm"), False)  # isTangentChain
```

The older `add*ChamferEdges` methods on the input object no longer exist. Argument order is a live trap on the two-value variants: `isFlipped` comes **before** `isTangentChain`.

| Set | Signature |
|---|---|
| Equal | `addEqualDistanceChamferEdgeSet(edges, distance, isTangentChain)` |
| Two distance | `addTwoDistancesChamferEdgeSet(edges, d1, d2, isFlipped, isTangentChain)` |
| Distance and angle | `addDistanceAndAngleChamferEdgeSet(edges, distance, angle, isFlipped, isTangentChain)` |

Note this also means chamfer supports tangent chaining, which the previous single-call form did not expose.

## Ribs are not scriptable (2026-07-18)

`RibFeatures` is a read-only collection in 2704.1.23. It has `item`, `itemByName`, and `count`, but no `createInput` and no `add`. There is no way to create a rib from the API.

Do not spend time debugging this; it is not a signature problem. Model the rib as a thin extrude instead: sketch the rib cross-section as a closed profile and extrude it with `operation='join'`. That is parametric, survives rebuilds, and gives you direct control over the wall thickness that the rib feature would have inferred.

Worth re-testing on future Fusion releases, since a read-only collection suggests the feature is exposed but not yet writable.

## An unset pattern direction two produces 3 coincident bodies (2026-07-18)

`RectangularPatternFeatureInput` does not treat an unconfigured direction two as "a single row". Leaving `setDirectionTwo` uncalled multiplies every instance by three, in place:

| Direction two | quantity=1 | quantity=4 |
|---|---|---|
| Not set | 3 bodies | 12 bodies |
| `setDirectionTwo(axis, 1, "0 mm")` | 1 body | 4 bodies |

**This is invisible to almost every check.** The feature is created, the API reports success, the positions along direction one are correct, and each body has exactly the right volume. Only the body count is wrong, and the duplicates are coincident so they are hard to see in the viewport too.

Always configure direction two, even for a single-direction pattern:

```python
pat_in.setDirectionTwo(
    root.yConstructionAxis,                          # must differ from direction one
    adsk.core.ValueInput.createByReal(1),
    adsk.core.ValueInput.createByString("0 mm"),
)
```

The second axis must not be the same entity as the first, or Fusion rejects the input. If direction one is Y, use Z.

**General lesson: count entities before and after any feature that replicates geometry.** Position and volume checks pass clean here.

## Hole placement picks a face, and "tallest" is the wrong heuristic (2026-07-18)

Positioning a hole by world XY requires choosing a face to place the sketch point on. Selecting the highest `+Z` face in the body is the obvious approach and it breaks on any stepped part: a hole aimed at a lower step gets placed on the plane of the taller one, floating in mid-air above its intended target.

The failure mode depends on the extent:

- Distance extent: `No target body found to cut or intersect!`
- Through-all: no error at all, but the hole starts from the wrong plane, so the depth and any counterbore land wrong.

**Prefer the highest `+Z` face whose XY extent actually contains the target point**, and fall back to tallest only when none does:

```python
for i in range(body.faces.count):
    f = body.faces.item(i)
    ok, n = f.evaluator.getNormalAtPoint(f.pointOnFace)
    if not (ok and abs(n.z - 1.0) < 1e-3):
        continue
    bb = f.boundingBox
    contains = (bb.minPoint.x <= tx <= bb.maxPoint.x and
                bb.minPoint.y <= ty <= bb.maxPoint.y)
    ...
```

Return the chosen face's Z in the result so callers can see which plane the hole actually started from. Note this whole approach is world-Z locked: rotate the body and there is no `+Z` face at all.

## areaProperties is a method, not a property (2026-07-18)

```python
prof.areaProperties.area        # returns a bound method's attribute: garbage
prof.areaProperties().area      # correct
```

The property form does not raise. It silently yields `None` in any downstream arithmetic, so area-based logic (matching profiles by size, sorting, picking the largest) degrades to whatever the fallback path is and appears to work.

This had been silently broken in profile matching for the lifetime of the code before anyone noticed, because the fallback (take profile 0) is correct in the single-profile case that covers most designs. If you have code selecting profiles by area and it "always seems to pick the first one", check for this.

## The .profile getter itself raises on a stale feature (2026-07-18)

Reading inputs from a broken feature is not safe. On an `ExtrudeFeature` whose sketch curves were deleted, the `.profile` getter raises rather than returning `None` or an empty collection:

```
InternalValidationError: res == 0
```

This matters for any "capture the inputs, delete, recreate" repair routine (see G10). The crash happens during capture, before you have anything to work with, and an uncaught exception rolls back the whole `execute` transaction.

Wrap every input read from a suspect feature, and treat a raising getter as "not rebuildable" so the original feature is preserved rather than destroyed by a repair that cannot finish.

**Related rule for any delete-then-recreate routine: validate everything you can before `deleteMe()`.** Check that the target sketch resolves unambiguously *and* that it still has at least one closed profile. A sketch that resolves but has `profiles.count == 0` passes a naive preflight, lets the delete run, then fails recreation, leaving the design with the feature simply gone.

## Generating Python? json.dumps(None) is not `None` (2026-07-18)

Specific to tools that generate Fusion scripts rather than calling the API directly, but it is a silent killer.

Interpolating a value with `json.dumps()` is correct for strings and wrong for everything else, because JSON's literals are not Python's:

| Value | `json.dumps()` emits | Valid Python? |
|---|---|---|
| `"45 deg"` | `"45 deg"` | yes |
| `None` | `null` | **no** |
| `True` | `true` | **no** |

The generated script then dies inside Fusion with `NameError: name 'null' is not defined`, at whatever line the token landed on.

**`ast.parse()` does not catch this.** `null`, `true`, and `false` are all syntactically valid Python identifiers, so the script parses cleanly and only fails at run time. A generator test suite built on `ast.parse` will pass while every real call fails.

Use `repr()` for anything that is not guaranteed to be a string, and test by walking the AST for `Name` nodes matching those three tokens:

```python
leaks = [n.id for n in ast.walk(ast.parse(src))
         if isinstance(n, ast.Name) and n.id in {"null", "true", "false"}]
```

## Reserved parameter names: `floor` is rejected (2026-07-31)

`design.userParameters.add('floor', ...)` fails with `RuntimeError: 3 : param name is not valid`.
The name collides with the built-in `floor()` expression function. This bites constantly because
`floor` is the obvious name for a tray's floor thickness.

Avoid as parameter names: `floor`, `ceil`, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `mod`, `round`, `sign`, `sqrt`,
`pi`, `e`, and the trig functions. Suffix instead: `floor_t`, `min_gap`, `max_reach`.

Verified 2026-07-31 by probe: `floor` REJECTED; `floor_t`, `wall`, `corner_r` all accepted.

The error message names no parameter, so in a 38-param batch add you get no clue which one failed.
Probe suspects individually (see the transaction gotcha below).

## A failed `execute` rolls back the ENTIRE script (2026-07-31)

The MCP `execute` call is one transaction. If any statement raises, everything the script did is
discarded, including work that already succeeded before the failure.

Observed: a 38-entry idempotent parameter add failed on `floor` about two-thirds through.
Afterwards `userParameters.count` was **0**, not 25. Again later, a `RectangularPatternFeatures.add`
threw at the end of a script that had already built a fully constrained sketch and a cut feature;
the sketch did not exist afterwards.

Two consequences:

1. **Idempotent scripts stay safe** (`if not params.itemByName(name)`), because a re-run starts from
   the same clean state. This is why the idempotent-add pattern matters more than it looks.
2. **Probe risky calls inside `try/except`** so the script itself returns success and the good work
   persists. Use this to test an unfamiliar API signature across several variants in ONE call
   instead of burning a round trip per guess:

```python
for label, ent in candidates:
    try:
        result = SomeApi.create(ent, opt)
        print(f"  {label}: OK {result.count}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"  {label}: FAIL {str(e).strip()[:80]}")
```

## `Path.create` requires an assembly-context proxy (2026-07-31)

`adsk.fusion.Path.create(entity, chainOptions)` fails on ANY entity native to a component:

```
RuntimeError: 2 : InternalValidationError : Utils::getObjectPath(sketchCurve, objPath, nullptr, contextPath)
```

Fix: pass the occurrence proxy.

```python
path = adsk.fusion.Path.create(
    curve.createForAssemblyContext(occurrence),
    adsk.fusion.ChainedCurveOptions.connectedChainedCurves)
```

Verified matrix, geometry inside a component occurrence:

| Entity | Result |
|---|---|
| native sketch line | FAIL |
| native construction line | FAIL |
| native `BRepEdge` | FAIL |
| proxied sketch line | OK |
| proxied construction line | OK |

Construction geometry is perfectly valid as a path. The proxy is the only thing that matters.

Related: prefer a sketch line over a body edge as a pattern path. Any cut you make along that edge
splits it into fragments, and the path silently stops covering the full span.

## Keep a feature in the SAME component as the bodies it touches (2026-07-31)

The mirror image of the `Path.create` gotcha. A feature created in the **root** component whose
`participantBodies` are occurrence body proxies cannot then be patterned:

```
RuntimeError: 2 : InternalValidationError : Utils::getObjectPath(feat, objPath, nullptr, path)
```

from `RectangularPatternFeatures.add`.

**Rule.** Create the feature inside the component that owns the body. Do not cut occurrence bodies
from root and then try to pattern the result.

This costs less than it sounds. If every occurrence uses an identity `Matrix3D`, a sketch placed at
the same world coordinates in three different components still lines up perfectly, so a pattern
built separately per component reads as continuous across the assembly. Build one component's set,
verify it, then batch the rest through a helper function.

## Pattern on Path with "Path Direction" DISCARDS a leaning seed (2026-07-31)

`PathPatternFeatureInput.isOrientationAlongPath = True` (the UI's **Path Direction**) re-derives
each instance's orientation from the path frame. Any tilt the seed carried relative to the path is
thrown away, and the seed itself is re-placed.

Reproduction: a cut cylinder built at 20 degrees from vertical, patterned 100 times around a closed
horizontal perimeter loop. Every instance came back **perfectly vertical**:

```python
for f in body.faces:
    g = f.geometry
    if isinstance(g, adsk.core.Cylinder) and g.radius < 0.3:
        print(g.axis, math.degrees(math.acos(abs(g.axis.z))))
# axis=(0,0,1)  lean_from_Z = 0.00   x100
```

The seed also moved: its flute ran from Z 1.75 instead of the intended Z 6.

`isOrientationAlongPath = False` (**Identical**) preserves the lean, but instances are then pure
translations, so they cannot wrap onto a face with a different normal.

**Leaning features and corner wrapping are mutually exclusive with this feature.** Pattern on Path
is right for something perpendicular to its path by design (the belt teeth in every tutorial). It
is wrong for a deliberately tilted seed. For tilted features, use a rectangular pattern per planar
face and accept that corners are not wrapped.

On a straight path, Pattern on Path with Identical orientation is exactly a rectangular pattern, so
there is no reason to reach for the more fragile feature.

## Angular sketch dimensions pick the wrong branch silently (2026-07-31)

Constraining a line's direction with `addAngularDimension` against a reference construction line has
two solutions, and the solver may take the mirror one. The sketch still reports
`isFullyConstrained = True`.

Observed: a flute axis meant to run from Z=6 up to Z=100 flipped and landed at **Z=-88**, fully
constrained, angle correct, direction inverted.

Fix: drop the angular dimension. Constrain the far endpoint with TWO component distance dimensions:

```python
sd.addDistanceDimension(F.startSketchPoint, F.endSketchPoint,
    DO.HorizontalDimensionOrientation, txt).parameter.expression = 'rib_len * sin(rib_lean)'
sd.addDistanceDimension(F.startSketchPoint, F.endSketchPoint,
    DO.VerticalDimensionOrientation, txt).parameter.expression = 'rib_len * cos(rib_lean)'
```

Distance dimensions are unsigned, so the solver holds whatever quadrant the geometry was drawn in,
and there is no second branch to fall into. It also removes the reference construction line and its
length dimension.

**Rule.** Assert DIRECTION, not just constraint state:

```python
ws, we = F.worldGeometry.startPoint, F.worldGeometry.endPoint
assert we.z > ws.z, 'axis is pointing downward'
```

`isFullyConstrained` tells you the sketch is solved. It does not tell you it solved the way you meant.

## A computed parameter that can go negative fails silently (2026-07-31)

Fusion does not complain when a computed `userParameter` resolves negative. It just produces
nonsense geometry downstream.

Observed: `m3_divider = outer_w - 2 * m3_edge_wall - brush_well_w - palette_slot_w`. Narrowing
`outer_w` from 220 to 194 drove it to **-20 mm**. No error anywhere.

**Rule.** After changing any headline dimension, print every dependent computed value and assert
the ones that must stay positive:

```python
for n in ['m3_divider', 'zone_w', 'pencil_depth']:
    v = design.userParameters.itemByName(n).value * 10
    assert v > 0, f'{n} went negative: {v:.2f} mm'
    print(f"  {n:16s} = {v:8.3f} mm")
```

Work the cascade out on paper BEFORE applying the edit. One headline change here forced three
downstream fixes (pencil pitch, brush well width, palette slot width).

## Restore-by-join: how to terminate a field of cuts on a clean boundary (2026-07-31)

A cut extruded along a tilted axis has an end cap perpendicular to THAT axis, so the cap is a tilted
ellipse. Starting such a cut exactly on the line where you want it to stop puts roughly half the cap
past that line, and a row of them reads as a sawtooth.

Do NOT try to land each cutter precisely on the boundary. Instead:

1. **Overrun.** Start the cut beyond the boundary by at least the cutter radius, so the whole tilted
   cap is buried in material you are about to restore.
2. **Restore.** Join back the region that should have stayed solid, placed in the timeline AFTER the
   cuts. It shears every instance off on exactly one plane.

```python
params.add('rib_z0', VI('plinth_h - rib_r'), 'mm', 'COMPUTED')   # 1. sink below the boundary
ei = ext.createInput(outer_sketch.profiles.item(0),               # 2. restore, reusing the
                     adsk.fusion.FeatureOperations.JoinFeatureOperation)  #    body's own profile
ei.setDistanceExtent(False, VI('plinth_h'))
ei.participantBodies = [body]
ext.add(ei).name = 'plinth_band'
```

One join handles hundreds of cut instances and produces an exactly planar result. Verify by querying
the cut faces, not by looking:

```python
zmins = [f.boundingBox.minPoint.z * 10 for f in body.faces
         if isinstance(f.geometry, adsk.core.Cylinder) and f.geometry.radius < 0.3]
print(min(zmins))   # must equal the boundary exactly
```

Three variants of the same move, all verified on one part:

| Boundary | Restore shape |
|---|---|
| Bottom edge of a fluted face | full outer profile, Z 0..band |
| Face that butts against another part | a pad on that face only, spanning the contact height |
| Vertical corner where two fluted faces meet | a wall-thick square post at the corner, full height |
| Top rim | a **RING**, outer profile offset inward. A solid block seals every cavity. |

**Timeline order is load-bearing.** The restore join must sit after the cuts it trims and before any
feature that cuts into the restored region. Twice on this part, downstream features (tongue/groove)
had to be deleted and re-created to land on the correct side of a newly inserted join. When
inserting into an existing timeline, work out what belongs on each side FIRST; delete-and-recreate
is cheaper and far more predictable than reordering through the API.

## Nested closed loops give two profiles; pick the ring by area (2026-07-31)

A sketch with an outer rectangle and an inward `sketch.offset()` produces TWO profiles: the inner
region, and the annular ring between them. Selecting the wrong one turns a rim band into a lid.

```python
profs = [(sk.profiles.item(i), sk.profiles.item(i).areaProperties().area)
         for i in range(sk.profiles.count)]
ring = min(profs, key=lambda t: t[1])[0]     # the ring is the smaller area
```

`sketch.offset(curves, insidePoint, distance)` builds the inner loop with a live offset constraint,
so the ring stays parametric; find the resulting offset dimension and bind its expression.

Note `areaProperties()` is a METHOD, not a property.

## A leaning cut can never terminate cleanly on a perpendicular boundary (2026-07-31)

Geometry limit worth knowing before you promise a customer a clean edge. A groove leaning `a` degrees
from vertical sweeps `h * tan(a)` horizontally over a face of height `h`. Over 70 mm at 20 degrees
that is 23 mm. So no VERTICAL line ever sits consistently between two flutes: whatever the width of
a vertical border, exactly one groove per edge gets clipped at a varying position and tapers to a
feather point.

There is no parameter that removes this. The only fixes are to make the flutes vertical, or to lean
the border to match. Usually the right answer is to accept it: the sliver is thin enough that the
slicer drops it.

The same argument in the other axis is why the restore-by-join trick works so well for HORIZONTAL
boundaries (plinth, top rim) and only partly for vertical ones.

## An unsigned distance dimension flips when its target is near zero (2026-07-31)

Sibling of the angular-dimension branch flip, and more common. `addDistanceDimension` is UNSIGNED,
so it constrains magnitude only. When the value is small, the solver is free to pick either side of
the origin and will sometimes pick the wrong one. `isFullyConstrained` still reports True.

Observed: a pocket meant to sit at Y = +3.5 mm landed at Y = **-3.5 mm**. Two sibling pockets
dimensioned at 47.5 and 132.5 were both correct. Only the near-zero one flipped.

**Rule.** Anchor whichever corner has the LARGER absolute coordinate, then assert the world
position. Instead of dimensioning the near edge at `inset` = 3.5, dimension the far edge at
`depth - inset` = 40.5:

```python
sd.addDistanceDimension(sk.originPoint, far_pt, DO.VerticalDimensionOrientation,
                        txt).parameter.expression = 'm1_depth - insert_inset'
assert far_pt.worldGeometry.y * 10 > 0, 'anchor solved to the mirror side'
```

Rough threshold: treat anything under ~10 mm as a coin flip. The fix costs nothing, so apply it
whenever a choice of anchor edge exists.

## Fusion auto-infers constraints on axis-aligned sketch geometry (2026-07-31)

Creating a sketch line that happens to be exactly horizontal or vertical silently adds a geometric
constraint. Budget your dimensions for the real DOF or you get:

```
RuntimeError: 3 : VCS_SKETCH_OVER_CONSTRAINTS - Sketch geometry is over constrained
```

Observed: a 4-point trapezoid has 8 DOF, so 8 distance dimensions should be exact. Two of its edges
were axis-aligned, Fusion inferred horizontal on both, real DOF was 6, and the 7th dimension threw.

**`isComputeDeferred = True` does NOT suppress the inference.**

Deterministic fix: draw the flat edges with a small jitter so nothing is exactly axis-aligned, then
add the constraints yourself.

```python
J = 0.07                                   # mm, on the second point of each flat edge
...                                        # build lines with pts[i][1] + J
sk.isComputeDeferred = False
assert sk.geometricConstraints.count == 0, 'Fusion still inferred something'
sk.geometricConstraints.addHorizontal(L0)
sk.geometricConstraints.addHorizontal(L2)
# now dimension exactly (2 * points - explicit_constraints) DOF
```

Asserting the constraint count turns an invisible assumption into a checked one. Without it you are
guessing how many dimensions the sketch will accept.

**Amended 2026-08-01: the inference is PER-API-CALL, not global.** `addCenterPointRectangle` does
the opposite. It creates **zero** geometric constraints, so the rectangle comes back a free
parallelogram, and adding four distance dimensions pulls the corners out of square. Observed 130.020
mm on a rectangle dimensioned to 130, caught only by a bounding-box assert.

So there is no rule of thumb to memorise, and both failure modes are silent in different directions:
`addByTwoPoints` on axis-aligned geometry over-constrains, `addCenterPointRectangle` under-constrains.

The one correct habit covers both:

```python
rect = sk.sketchCurves.sketchLines.addCenterPointRectangle(P(0, 0, 0), P(6.5, 4.5, 0))
print(f"inferred constraints: {sk.geometricConstraints.count}")   # PROBE, never assume
# add only what is missing, then dimension the remaining DOF
```

Follow it with a geometry assert, not just `isFullyConstrained`, because a fully-constrained sketch
can still be constrained to the wrong shape:

```python
pts = [p.geometry for L in lines for p in (L.startSketchPoint, L.endSketchPoint)]
assert abs(min(p.x for p in pts) * 10 + 65.0) < 1e-4, 'width wrong'
```

## `setTwoSidesDistanceExtent` direction one is NOT `setDistanceExtent` positive (2026-07-31)

On the same sketch plane, the two APIs disagree about which way is positive.

Observed on an XY sketch where `setDistanceExtent(False, ...)` had already been proven to extrude
**+Z**: `setTwoSidesDistanceExtent(VI('2 mm'), VI('m1_height + 5 mm'))` sent the LARGE distance
DOWNWARD, out of the body. The cut removed 0.112 cm^3 against 1.906 predicted, i.e. exactly the
2 mm of height from the small side.

No error. The feature reports healthy. Only the volume reveals it.

```python
v0 = body.volume
...
got, exp = v0 - body.volume, predicted_cm3
assert abs(got - exp) < 0.01, f'cut removed {got:.3f}, expected {exp:.3f}'
```

**Rule.** Prefer one-sided `setDistanceExtent` with an overrun, in a direction you have already
proven on that plane, over a two-sided extent whose sign convention you are assuming. If you must
go two-sided, verify by volume before building anything on top of it.

## Coplanar adjacent faces MERGE, which breaks face-based selection (2026-07-31)

When a new feature lands coplanar with and adjacent to existing geometry, Fusion merges them into
one BRepFace. Any heuristic that counts faces or filters them by area then silently finds the wrong
thing.

Observed: a dovetail joined to a wall, its top face coplanar with an adjacent pad strip. Expected
two clean trapezoid faces of ~21.8 mm^2 with 4 edges each. Got one merged face of 33.33 mm^2 with
10 edges and another of 29.47 mm^2 with 8, so an area filter found one where two were expected.

**Fix: select EDGES by world coordinates, not faces by area.** Edge geometry survives the merge.

```python
edges = adsk.core.ObjectCollection.create()
for e in body.edges:
    bb = e.boundingBox
    z0, z1 = bb.minPoint.z*10, bb.maxPoint.z*10
    y0, y1 = bb.minPoint.y*10, bb.maxPoint.y*10
    if abs(z0 - ztop) > 0.02 or abs(z1 - ztop) > 0.02:      # lies flat at the target height
        continue
    if y1 > y_face + 0.02 or y0 < y_face - depth - 0.02:    # inside the feature's own band
        continue
    if abs(y1 - y_face) < 0.02 and abs(y0 - y_face) < 0.02: # drop edges wholly on the mating plane
        continue
    edges.add(e)
assert edges.count == expected, f'got {edges.count} edges'
```

Always assert the count. The filter is the hypothesis; the assert is the test.

## File size is NOT an export health check (2026-07-31)

An all-planar part tessellates to very few triangles, so a correct STL can look suspiciously tiny
next to a curved one. Observed on one model: a 60-triangle insert (3 KB) and a 172-triangle insert
(8 KB) beside a 13,080-triangle fluted shell (652 KB). All three were correct.

Do not eyeball file sizes. Parse the binary header:

```python
raw = open(path, 'rb').read()
n = struct.unpack('<I', raw[80:84])[0]
assert len(raw) == 84 + n * 50, 'truncated or not binary STL'
lo, hi = [1e9]*3, [-1e9]*3
for i in range(n):
    o = 84 + i*50 + 12                      # skip the 12-byte normal
    for v in range(3):
        for a in range(3):
            x = struct.unpack('<f', raw[o+v*12+a*4 : o+v*12+a*4+4])[0]
            lo[a], hi[a] = min(lo[a], x), max(hi[a], x)
# compare lo/hi against body.boundingBox, and n against expectation
```

The bbox comparison is the part that matters: it proves the export contains the geometry you just
built, not a stale body or an empty selection.

## Fusion REJECTS shear transforms (2026-08-01)

There is no way to shear a body. All three transform entry points validate for rigid transforms only
and refuse a non-orthogonal `Matrix3D`:

```
moveFeatures.createInput2(coll) + defineAsFreeMove(m)  -> 2 : InternalValidationError : transform_raw(transform)
moveFeatures.createInput(coll, m)                      -> 3 : invalid argument transform
TemporaryBRepManager.transform(body, m)                -> 3 : invalid argument transform
```

Three independent rejections; treat it as a hard limit rather than an API-choice problem.

This matters most when a finished model needs to lean. A shear would preserve every existing feature
in one call; instead the lean has to be built into the geometry from the start.

**Fix: build the shear as a LOFT between two identical profiles**, the upper one offset laterally.

```python
li = lofts.createInput(adsk.fusion.FeatureOperations.NewBodyFeatureOperation)
li.loftSections.add(sk_bot.profiles.item(0))     # rect at z = 0,   centred at y = 0
li.loftSections.add(sk_top.profiles.item(0))     # same rect at z = h, centred at y = h*tan(lean)
li.isSolid = True
body = lofts.add(li).bodies.item(0)
assert abs(body.volume - w * d * h / 1000.0) < 0.01   # Cavalieri: a shear preserves volume
```

That volume identity is a free correctness check on the whole construction.

**Do not substitute a rigid rotation.** For a leaning body with a FLAT BASE the two are not
interchangeable: a rotation tilts the bottom face, so a flat base needs a horizontal trim, and that
trim reaches `(depth / 2) * tan(lean)` up at the rear edge. It forces a wedge foot and cuts into
whatever the walls carry. A shear keeps horizontal top and bottom faces and the full footprint.

## Wall thickness and clearance are PERPENDICULAR quantities (2026-08-01)

On any face that is not axis-aligned, mixing a perpendicular thickness with an axis-aligned
dimension silently loses a factor of `cos(angle)`.

The Shell feature offsets `t` perpendicular to every face. On a face leaning by `a`, that same wall
measures `t / cos(a)` along the axis. So deriving a mating part's axis-aligned dimension as
`outer - 2*wall - 2*gap` under-delivers the clearance.

```python
# vertical faces
insert_w = 'outer_w - 2 * ( wall + fit_gap )'
# leaning faces  <- the / cos(lean) is NOT optional
insert_d = 'outer_d - 2 * ( wall + fit_gap ) / cos(lean)'
```

Observed on a 15 degree face: 0.304 mm of clearance where 0.400 was intended, with no error
anywhere. Only a perpendicular measurement found it.

The corrected form has a second payoff: the corner fillet axes of the two parts then coincide
exactly, so the clearance is uniform around the corners instead of varying.

## `ConstructionAxes.setByLine` is unsupported in the parametric environment (2026-08-01)

```
RuntimeError: 3 : Environment is not supported
```

Raised by `root.constructionAxes.add(input)` after `input.setByLine(InfiniteLine3D...)`.

**Fix: use a sketch construction line as the direction entity.** Rectangular patterns, and anything
else taking a direction, accept a `SketchLine`.

```python
sk = root.sketches.add(root.yZConstructionPlane)
ln = sk.sketchCurves.sketchLines.addByTwoPoints(P(0, 0, 0), P(-L*cos_a, L*sin_a, 0))
ln.isConstruction = True
sk.geometricConstraints.addCoincident(ln.startSketchPoint, sk.originPoint)
# two COMPONENT distance dims, never an angular dim (mirror branch, see the angular gotcha)
sd.addDistanceDimension(..., DO.HorizontalDimensionOrientation, ...).parameter.expression = '50 mm * cos(lean)'
sd.addDistanceDimension(..., DO.VerticalDimensionOrientation,   ...).parameter.expression = '50 mm * sin(lean)'
# then ASSERT the resulting world direction, not just isFullyConstrained
```

## `addScribedPolygon`: no dimensions, an extra point, and a plane-dependent angle (2026-08-01)

`sketchLines.addScribedPolygon(centre, sides, angle, radius, isInscribed)` works and applies a
`PolygonConstraint`, but three things surprise:

1. **It ships no dimensions and no construction circle.** The polygon is regular but free in centre,
   size and rotation: 4 DOF. Constrain with one horizontal/vertical on the single axis-aligned edge
   (rotation), one centre-to-vertex distance dim (size), and two origin-to-centre dims (position).
2. **The centre is created as an EXTRA sketch point** beyond the 6 vertices. `SketchPoint` is
   **unhashable**, so separating it from the vertices with `set()` membership throws
   `TypeError: cannot use 'adsk.fusion.SketchPoint' as a set element`. Match on geometry instead.
3. **Which `angle` gives a pointy top depends on the PLANE**, because the plane mapping flips an
   axis: `pi/6` on XZ, `0` on YZ.

Do not reason about (3). Try both and keep whichever puts exactly one vertex at max WORLD Z:

```python
for angle in (0.0, math.pi / 6.0):
    sk = root.sketches.add(plane)
    pg = sk.sketchCurves.sketchLines.addScribedPolygon(P(cx, cy, 0), 6, angle, r, True)
    zs = sorted(v.startSketchPoint.worldGeometry.z for v in [pg.item(i) for i in range(pg.count)])
    if len([z for z in zs if abs(z - zs[-1]) < 1e-9]) == 1:
        break            # single apex at the top
    sk.deleteMe()
```

## A computed value written as a literal dimension expression de-parameterises silently (2026-08-01)

Computing an anchor distance in Python and assigning it as a literal LOOKS correct, because the
number is right and the geometry lands exactly where intended:

```python
d.parameter.expression = f'{x_val} mm'      # WRONG: pins the feature forever
d.parameter.expression = 'insert_in_w / 2'  # right
```

Nothing errors, no feature fails, and `isFullyConstrained` stays True. The damage only appears later,
when changing a driving parameter moves some geometry and leaves the literal-pinned features behind,
producing wrong wall thicknesses with no failure anywhere.

Related trap already documented elsewhere: restoring a dimension with `p.value` also replaces the
expression with a literal. Always use `p.expression`.

**Add an end-of-build sweep.** Three lines, and it is the only thing that catches this:

```python
import re
literals = []
for i in range(root.sketches.count):
    sk = root.sketches.item(i)
    for j in range(sk.sketchDimensions.count):
        e = sk.sketchDimensions.item(j).parameter.expression
        if re.fullmatch(r'\s*-?[\d.]+\s*(mm|cm|deg)?\s*', e or ''):
            literals.append(f'{sk.name}[{j}] = {e}')
assert not literals, f'literal-valued dimensions: {literals}'
```

## A square cavity inside a filleted profile leaves a razor-thin corner (2026-08-01)

Cutting an axis-aligned rectangular cavity inside a round-cornered outer profile makes the CORNER the
thinnest point, and the arithmetic is not intuitive. With an outer corner radius of 5.2 and the
cavity inset 3.2 on both axes, the cavity corner sits `sqrt(3.2^2 + 3.2^2) = 4.525` mm from the arc
centre, leaving `5.2 - 4.525 = 0.675` mm of wall where 2.0 was intended. No error, no warning.

**Fix, exact rather than approximate:** fillet the cavity corners at

```
cav_r = outer_corner_r - wall
```

That places the cavity arc centre exactly ON the outer arc centre. The two arcs become concentric and
the wall is a perfect annulus of `wall` right around the corner. Verify by pulling both cylinder faces
and differencing the radii.

## "Saved" means saved to the CLOUD, not to disk (2026-08-01)

After a user saves in the Fusion UI, `doc_state` reports the document name and `is_dirty false`, and
the SKU folder can still be completely empty. A clean document state says the cloud copy is current
and says nothing about the filesystem.

**After a save, verify the FILESYSTEM, not the document state.**

The local archive is a separate export step, and it IS automatable once the document has a name, so
only the first Save As is genuinely manual:

```python
em = design.exportManager
em.execute(em.createFusionArchiveExportOptions(f'{out}/{SKU}.f3d'))
em.execute(em.createSTEPExportOptions(f'{out}/{SKU}.step'))
assert os.path.getsize(f'{out}/{SKU}.f3d') > 1000
```

## Wiping a model: delete TIMELINE FEATURES first, then sketches (2026-08-01)

Deleting sketches and construction planes before their consuming features orphans those features and
leaves timeline entries that cannot be removed individually:

```
AttributeError: 'TimelineObject' object has no attribute 'deleteMe'
```

Correct order is features, then sketches, then planes and axes, then bodies. If you have already
orphaned them, recover with a repeated-pass loop that deletes through the timeline entity and
restarts after each success, since indices shift:

```python
for _pass in range(40):
    if tl.count == 0:
        break
    progress = False
    for i in range(tl.count - 1, -1, -1):
        try:
            ent = tl.item(i).entity
        except Exception:
            ent = None
        if ent is None:
            continue
        try:
            ent.deleteMe()
            progress = True
            break
        except Exception:
            continue
    if not progress:
        break
```

## `interference_check` cannot tell a slip fit from a press fit (2026-08-01, reinforces 2026-07-31)

Already noted for coincident faces; worth restating with the fix, because it recurred on a second
product. It reports 0 pairs for a zero-clearance fit, a correct 0.4 mm fit, and surfaces that merely
touch. It proves parts do not OVERLAP and says nothing about whether they FIT.

Measure instead, **along each face normal**, and assert two things, not one:

```python
gap_lo, gap_hi = i_lo - s_lo, s_hi - i_hi
off = ((i_hi + i_lo) / 2) - ((s_hi + s_lo) / 2)
assert abs(gap_lo - target) < 2e-3 and abs(gap_hi - target) < 2e-3
assert abs(off) < 1e-6, 'correct total gap, but sitting all on one side'
```

**Filter the faces tightly.** On a patterned or pocketed body there are hundreds of planar faces with
the same normal; a naive min/max over all of them picks up pattern facets and produces nonsense. Band
the filter around the expected offset.

## Fusion rejects a NUMERICALLY redundant dimension and leaves the sketch under-constrained (2026-08-03)

A closed loop of N chained lines has exactly 2N degrees of freedom, so 2N distance dimensions from
the origin should fully constrain it. They do not, and the failure is silent in the worst way: the
call raises `VCS_SKETCH_OVER_CONSTRAINTS`, and if you catch it and carry on you are left with an
under-constrained sketch that looks finished.

The cause is that Fusion tests redundancy against the CURRENT geometry, not the structure. Build a
rhombus with its top and bottom vertices at the same `u`, and a dimension pinning the second one is
judged already implied even though nothing constrains it.

Measured on a 4-line rhombus, adding dimensions one at a time:

```
dim 1: T.H OK    dim 2: T.V OK    dim 3: R.H OK    dim 4: R.V OK
dim B.H FAILED after 4 accepted
dim 5: B.V OK    dim 6: L.H OK    dim 7: L.V OK
7 of 8 accepted, isFullyConstrained still False
```

**Fix: create the geometry jittered so no two vertices share a coordinate, then let the dimensions
pull it into exact shape.** A few tenths of a millimetre is enough, and every dimension then binds.

```python
J = 0.03   # cm
l1 = L.addByTwoPoints(P(cu + J, cv - hv, 0), P(cu + hu, cv + J, 0))
l2 = L.addByTwoPoints(l1.endSketchPoint, P(cu - J, cv + hv, 0))
...
assert sk.isFullyConstrained, 'under-constrained'
```

For a polygon with many repeated coordinates, jitter each vertex by a DIFFERENT amount
(`0.005 * (k + 1)`, alternating sign) so no tie survives anywhere.

To diagnose an unfamiliar shape, count the accepted dimensions: wrap each `addDistanceDimension` in
try/except, tally the successes, and compare against the DOF you expected. That is far faster than
reasoning about which constraint Fusion inferred.

## `addByTwoPoints` infers constraints even with `isComputeDeferred = True` (2026-08-03)

Deferring compute does not disable constraint inference. A chained polygon comes back carrying
horizontal, vertical and perpendicular constraints you never asked for, which is the first reason
a dimension set gets rejected as over-constraining.

Purge them before dimensioning, and assert the purge worked AFTER re-enabling compute, because
`geometricConstraints.count` reads 0 while compute is still deferred and will happily pass a check
placed too early:

```python
while sk.geometricConstraints.count:
    sk.geometricConstraints.item(0).deleteMe()
sk.isComputeDeferred = False
assert sk.geometricConstraints.count == 0, 'constraints survived the purge'
```

## STEP export snapshots only the ACTIVE bodies (2026-08-03)

`createSTEPExportOptions` writes the current geometry, not the feature tree. On a document holding
several suppressed variant blocks, the STEP contains whichever one happened to be unsuppressed and
silently omits the rest.

The tell is a file size that barely moves. A model whose `.f3d` went from 701 KB to 1.34 MB after
three new pattern blocks were added exported a STEP of 1,732,772 bytes against the previous
1,733,405: essentially unchanged, because only one configuration was ever in it.

If variants matter, either export one STEP per variant (activate, export, repeat) or state plainly
in the SKU README that the STEP is single-configuration. The `.f3d` archive is the only artifact
that carries them all.

## STL and 3MF tessellate independently; never cross-check one against the other (2026-08-03)

Both exporters accept `MeshRefinementHigh`, and it is tempting to verify an export pair by comparing
triangle counts. They will not match, and the ratio is not even constant:

| body | STL tris | 3MF tris | ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| hex shell | 5,528 | 6,720 | 1.22 |
| dogtooth shell | 3,328 | 4,520 | 1.36 |
| flower shell | 20,096 | 33,000 | 1.64 |

3MF is consistently finer and its mesh volume tracks CAD more tightly (+/-0.036% against the STL's
+/-0.15%). Neither is wrong. **Verify each format against CAD volume and bounding box, never against
the other format.**

Worth checking on 3MF specifically, since it is a zip and can be parsed directly: `unit` is
`millimeter`, exactly one `<object>` carries a mesh, and the edge-use map has every edge used twice
(watertight). A `<triangle>` regex count over the `.model` parts is enough for the count; parse the
vertices for volume.

## Sketch profile computation does not scale to a large arrangement of overlapping curves (2026-08-03)

Roughly 100 mutually overlapping circles in one sketch does not merely run slowly, it does not
return. A probe that built the circles and then read `sketch.profiles.count` timed out with no
result. The rollback was clean, so nothing was left behind, but no amount of patience helps.

This rules out the obvious construction for any arrangement-based pattern (flower of life,
overlapping-circle lattices, Voronoi from generators): you cannot draw the generators and let Fusion
find the faces between them.

**Do the arrangement offline and hand Fusion finished, non-overlapping closed loops.** Explicit
three-point arcs work well and need no coincident constraints; 208 arcs describing 86 disjoint cells
resolved to exactly 86 profiles, instantly. See patterns.md, "Analytic cell decomposition".

The cost is parametricity: such a sketch carries literal coordinates and will not rescale with the
drivers. Budget for one block per size, named accordingly, and keep the generator script beside the
CAD source rather than in a scratch directory.

## The union of overlapping loops is NOT the union of the arrangement's profiles (2026-08-03)

23 overlapping closed polygons (a generated mountain-and-forest silhouette, 568 points) resolve to
111 profiles in a few seconds, so unlike ~100 overlapping circles this arrangement is perfectly
tractable. The trap is what you do next.

Extruding **every** profile as one Join came out **4.77% heavy**. The arrangement turns each
*enclosed void* into a profile too: the pocket of sky bounded above by a mountain, on the sides by
two trees and below by a shrub is a legitimate face of the arrangement, and extruding it fills the
sky.

**Select only the profiles that lie inside at least one source loop.** With the loops in hand, that
is an even-odd point-in-polygon test per profile. On this part 101 were kept and 10 rejected.

The check that proves it is a volume comparison against an independent union area computed offline
(scanline, dz 0.002 to 0.01 mm). Screenshots do not show a filled sky pocket if a tree happens to
sit in front of it.

## A profile's centroid is not reliably inside the profile (2026-08-03)

The obvious way to classify an arrangement profile is `profile.areaProperties().centroid`, tested
against the source loops. It is *nearly* right and it was still **798.6 mm^3 heavy**, because the
centroid of a non-convex fragment can fall outside the fragment, so a few sky pockets tested as
material and got filled.

Use a **guaranteed interior point** instead. Walk the profile's outer loop, and for each edge
midpoint step a short distance (0.05 mm, comfortably under the smallest feature) along the inward
normal. The inward direction is fixed by the ring's signed area: for a CCW ring the interior is left
of travel, so the inward normal of edge `(dx, dy)` is `(-dy, dx)`. Reject any sample that fails
point-in-polygon against the ring itself, then majority-vote the survivors. See patterns.md,
"Classify arrangement profiles by a guaranteed interior point".

The give-away that something was wrong was three independent measurements of the same area
disagreeing: scanline 12249.65 mm^2 (stable from dz 0.01 to 0.002), raster 12283.86 at 0.05 mm, CAD
12410.19. **Two agreeing methods would not have shown which one was wrong.** CAD was the outlier.

## Deleting a join silently deletes fillets downstream that reference its faces (2026-08-03)

Deleting an extrude-Join to rebuild it also removed a fillet 20 entries later in the timeline, with
**no error and no warning**. The fillet ran along an edge on the plate's front face; that face was a
product of the join, so the fillet depended on it. The only visible symptom was the feature count
dropping from 16 to 15 and the volume being 858 mm^3 light, which is exactly the fillet.

**Snapshot the feature-name list before deleting any join, and diff it afterwards.** Do not rely on
an exception. This recurred on all four rebuilds of the same feature, so the restore step is worth
making unconditional rather than conditional on noticing.

Order matters when you put it back. Two fillets that touch the same edge chain are not commutative;
restoring the gusset *after* the outline ease produced a different body than restoring it *before*.
Roll `timeline.markerPosition` to the original slot rather than appending.

## Mesh density can be driven by `aspectRatio`, not by deviation (2026-08-03)

A 250 x 114 x 100 mm part that is mostly flat faces exported at **427,870 triangles / 21 MB**.
Sweeping `surfaceDeviation` from 0.01 mm to 0.05 mm changed the triangle count by **exactly zero**.

The driver was `STLExportOptions.aspectRatio`, which defaults to **21.5** and subdivides large planar
faces to keep triangles from getting long and thin. Setting it to **0 (unlimited)** gave 80,224
triangles and 4.01 MB at identical accuracy (+0.0001% against CAD either way).

| aspectRatio | triangles | size |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (unlimited) | 80,224 | 4.01 MB |
| 21.5 (default) | 427,870 | 21.39 MB |
| 50 | 228,168 | 11.41 MB |
| 200 | 115,778 | 5.79 MB |
| 1000 | 84,318 | 4.22 MB |

**The response is not monotonic**: 50 is worse than the default. Do not reason about this value,
measure it. For a part dominated by curvature, deviation is the lever; for a part dominated by large
flat faces, `aspectRatio` is, and tightening deviation just wastes time.

## A fillet at an acute wedge removes ~4x more material than the 90-degree estimate (2026-08-03)

`(1 - pi/4) r^2` per unit length is the removal for a fillet on a **90 degree** convex edge, and it
is exact enough to assert on to four decimals. It is only valid at 90 degrees.

A 1 mm fillet on 20 edges of five hook tips removed 94.77 mm^3 against a predicted 55.8. The model
was right and the estimate was wrong: three of the four edges per tip are square, but the fourth is
where a 39.8 degree ramp meets the end face, an **included angle of 50.19 degrees**. The general
form is

```
removal per unit length = r^2 * ( cot(theta/2) - (pi - theta)/2 )
```

which gives 0.2146 r^2 at 90 degrees and 0.953 r^2 at 50.2 degrees, a factor of 4.4. Re-checking
against the general form agreed to 4.4%. **Any ramp, taper or draft breaks the 90-degree shortcut.**

## `isTangentChain = True` propagates a fillet far past the edges you selected (2026-08-03)

Four straight edges were selected, bounding one flat face at the front of a shelf. The fillet removed
408.68 mm^3 against 274.5 predicted for those four edges. The chain had run around two 30 mm corner
sweeps and back down both sides of the shelf, easing the **entire outline**: predicted removal for
the full perimeter is 409.6, which matches.

In this case the wider result was better and was kept. That is luck, not design. If the fillet must
stay on the selected edges, pass `False`; if the chain is wanted, predict the removal for the whole
tangent-continuous chain, not for the selection, or the assert will fire on a correct feature.

## Keep diagnostics trivial inside long build scripts (2026-08-03)

A format-string bug in a progress `print` (three specifiers, four arguments) threw after a 568-point
sketch had been rebuilt and its profiles classified. A failed `execute` rolls back the **whole**
script, so the entire correct rebuild was discarded for a typo in a status line.

Compute expensive geometry first, assert on it, and keep the reporting to plain `%s` and single-value
`%f` until the script has proven itself. Anything clever in a `print` is a rollback risk out of all
proportion to its value.

## Extrude silently defaults to Join and merges parts that only touch (2026-09-20)

Whenever a new extrude profile touches or overlaps existing solid geometry, Fusion's Operation
dropdown defaults to **Join** rather than New Body/New Component. In a woodworking model this
routinely and silently fuses two physically separate parts (e.g. two side panels extruded in one
operation) into a single component with a meaningless combined bounding box. This is the single
most-repeated specific mistake across the whole reviewed tutorial corpus -- flagged independently
in nearly every multi-part build video, and even self-flagged on camera by one instructor ("Fusion
doesn't really care about woodwork... it just makes some choices that are right for the majority,
not necessarily right for you"). Fix: check the Operation dropdown on every single extrude that
touches other geometry, not just the ones that look ambiguous; default to New Component for
anything meant to be an independent real-world part.

## Fillet and Chamfer only blend/chain within one body -- cross-body edges need Combine first (2026-09-20)

A Fillet or Chamfer across an edge shared by two touching-but-separate bodies/components will only
affect one side (or produce a visually broken result) because these tools treat each body's edges
independently. If a continuous blended fillet or chamfer across a shared seam is wanted (e.g. a
rounded transition between an apron and a leg), Join the bodies with Combine first, then fillet/
chamfer the resulting single-body edge.

## Combine's "Keep Tools" checkbox is off by default and easy to forget (2026-09-20)

Running Combine > Cut without checking "Keep Tools" deletes the tool body after the operation
completes. In the standard woodworking "model the tenon, then cut the mortise from it" workflow
(patterns.md #81/#88), forgetting this checkbox deletes the tenon board itself along with cutting
the mortise -- an easy, silent, and (without undo) destructive mistake. Check "Keep Tools"
deliberately on essentially every woodworking Combine > Cut.

## Deleting a construction plane breaks every mirror/feature anchored to it (2026-09-20)

Cited independently at least four times across different sources in the reviewed corpus, including
one instructor explicitly admitting he's "made this mistake a couple of times": deleting a
construction plane that a Mirror (or other derived feature) depends on breaks the parametric
reference silently, typically producing a failed/dangling feature on the next rebuild rather than
an immediate obvious error. Treat construction planes that any mirror or other feature references
as permanent model infrastructure -- hide them if the tree looks cluttered, never delete them.

## Mirrored components can fragment BOM/parts-table quantity counts (2026-09-20)

One source in the reviewed corpus found that Mirror-duplicated components appear as separate line
items in an auto-generated drawing parts table (often suffixed "(Mirror)") rather than rolling up
into "quantity 2" of the shared source component, because table roll-up matches by component name/
identity and a mirrored instance doesn't share it. The same source states he "should have just
copied them" instead. A second source uses Mirror on BOM-scheduled parts (roof rafters) without
checking whether the same fragmentation occurs -- this is a known risk, not confirmed universal
behavior, so if a drawing's BOM must report accurate quantities, verify how mirrored parts actually
roll up in that specific table rather than assuming, and prefer Copy over Mirror for schedule-
sensitive parts when in doubt.

## Body vs. component confusion breaks BOM scheduling and edit-propagating duplication (2026-09-20)

Plain bodies (as opposed to components) don't schedule correctly in a drawing's parts-list/BOM
table, and duplicating geometry as bodies (rather than component instances) means editing one copy
does not update the others the way editing a component instance would. One source that otherwise
demonstrates a genuinely parameter-driven drawer-count/height formula explicitly admits mid-video
that he doesn't understand the body/component distinction or whether it matters for his model --
a real methodological gap worth checking for in any "parametric" design that hasn't deliberately
addressed this distinction. See patterns.md #85.

## Manually-entered part metadata does not auto-update on resize or tree reorganization (2026-09-20)

Only a component's *name* propagates automatically through the model. Manually-typed part numbers
(tied to tree position/hierarchy) and description text (e.g. "42 x 29" dimensions typed once) go
stale silently after the model is resized or the component tree is reorganized -- neither is
recomputed automatically. Given how often a parametric woodworking model gets resized during
design iteration, any generated BOM or drawing needs a manual metadata re-audit pass before being
treated as final, not just a visual check that the geometry looks right.

## Hand-typed literal dimensions de-parameterize a feature even inside an otherwise parametric model (2026-09-20)

Typing a literal number directly into a dimension or extrude-distance field (instead of a parameter
name or expression) detaches that one feature from the parametric system even when every other
dimension around it is parameter-driven -- the model will look and behave as fully parametric until
that specific feature is the one that needed to change. This was observed repeatedly across the
corpus even in projects that otherwise take parametrization seriously (a raised-panel corner-curve
radius set to a bare literal "20" is one specific example; a hardcoded absolute cut distance
another). Audit dimension fields for stray literals specifically, since a quick visual check of the
model won't reveal them.

## A parametrically-driven feature can silently revert to a hardcoded literal after being re-edited (2026-09-20)

In one source, a dovetail-count pattern was originally tied to a `dovetail_quantity` parameter but
stopped updating when the parameter changed; investigating found the pattern's quantity field had
been left at a literal 5 rather than the parameter reference, requiring the instructor to re-open
and re-fix the feature by hand ("I don't know why this doesn't work" was the on-camera reaction
before finding it). Treat "the model isn't updating after a parameter change" as reason to check
the specific feature's own input fields for a silently-reverted literal, not just to assume the
parameter itself is wrong.

## Pattern spacing is measured center-to-center, not edge-to-edge (2026-09-20)

A Rectangular Pattern's spacing/distance value is measured between the centers of the first and
last instance, not from the outer edges of the pattern's footprint. A naive `count * spacing`
formula for total occupied width will overshoot; correct for this with explicit half-width offset
arithmetic in the driving parameter/expression, confirmed as a gotcha independently in more than
one source.

## A Mirror applied to a Pattern is not parametrically linked back to it (2026-09-20)

Mirroring an already-patterned set of features does not keep the mirrored copy synchronized with
later edits to the original pattern's parameters. The workaround demonstrated: create a second,
independent Rectangular Pattern that explicitly references the *same* underlying dimension ID as
the first (e.g. by grabbing the first pattern's dimension ID, such as `D102`, and typing it into
the second pattern's spacing field) so both patterns move together under future parameter changes,
rather than relying on Mirror to keep them in sync.

## Sign and anchor-direction errors in hand-built parametric height/offset formulas (2026-09-20)

One source explicitly warns that a derived-height formula's sign (add vs. subtract) can flip
depending on which direction the model's anchor/axis runs, and that the formula "may need to start
with a negative total height and add rather than subtract" depending on setup -- i.e. a hand-built
parametric formula's correctness is not just about getting the right terms, but getting their sign
right relative to the specific sketch's anchor convention, and this should be explicitly checked
(e.g. by testing a parameter change and confirming the model grows in the intended direction) rather
than assumed from the formula's algebra alone.

## Radius-vs-diameter and similar unit-role mixups in derived expressions (2026-09-20)

While building a raised-panel-door reveal formula, one source live-caught a mixup where a parameter
named `joinery` (defined as a radius-scale value) was used in a spot that geometrically needed a
diameter, introducing a silent 2x dimensional error until caught and corrected on camera. Review
any formula that mixes multiple named parameters against what each one actually represents
geometrically (radius vs. diameter, half-width vs. full-width), not just whether the formula
"looks visually correct" on the current model state -- a 2x error like this can be invisible unless
the affected feature happens to be checked at a size where it's obviously wrong.

## Angle-derived dimensions can diverge from their nominal value and break cut-list grouping (2026-09-20)

Trig-derived dimensions on angled/compound geometry can come out numerically close-but-not-exactly
equal to their intended nominal value (e.g. 0.749" instead of a clean 0.75"), which is invisible in
normal use but can break a downstream tool that groups cut-list entries by exact identical size.
The workaround shown was a trivial small forced join-extrude to normalize the dimension to a
consistent referenced thickness. Worth checking when feeding angled-geometry parts into any
external nesting/cut-list tool that groups by exact dimension match.

## Deleting an empty sub-assembly node with "Delete" cascades and removes referenced components -- use "Remove" instead (2026-09-20)

In the component browser tree, "Delete" on an empty or unwanted sub-assembly grouping cascades and
strips out components that are still referenced elsewhere (e.g. still used by the timeline),
whereas "Remove" safely un-nests the grouping's children without touching the underlying
components. This is a real, easy-to-trigger footgun during routine tree cleanup, not an edge case.

## Auto Explode produces a poor starting arrangement -- build exploded views by hand (2026-09-20)

Two independent sources in the reviewed corpus both separately concluded that Fusion's "Auto
Explode" feature gives an unusable or poor-quality result on their models and switched to manually
dragging each component's transform handles in the Animation workspace instead. Treat Auto Explode
as, at best, a rough starting point to manually clean up, never a finished result.

## A drawing linked to the design goes silently stale after a model change (2026-09-20)

After editing the source model (including an Animation storyboard used for a posed/exploded drawing
view), any drawing sheet built from it keeps showing the old geometry until its update/refresh
("out of date," yellow marker) icon is manually clicked -- there's no automatic re-sync. Noted
independently by more than one source as an easy step to forget, especially right before exporting
or sharing a drawing.

## Wood-grain texture-map orientation defaults are usually wrong and need a manual per-component fix before rendering (2026-09-20)

Fusion's automatic texture mapping frequently orients wood-grain the wrong way (e.g. grain running
vertically on what should be a horizontal-grain side panel), and this is not a one-time setup --
each component needs Texture Map Controls (Box projection) checked and corrected individually, and
adjacent same-material parts should be deliberately varied (not left visually identical) or the
render reads as an obviously repeated texture tile. Treat this as a mandatory QA pass before a
final render, not an optional polish step.

## Joint sliding/rotation axis is easy to get wrong by trial and error instead of reasoning from the sketch (2026-09-20)

Across several sources, the axis for a Slider or rotational Joint (drawer travel direction, door
swing axis) is chosen by cycling through x/y/z options and watching the Animate preview rather than
reasoned out from how the underlying sketch/component axes are actually defined. This works but is
inefficient and non-reproducible; where the geometry's intended axis is known in advance, set it
directly rather than trial-and-error cycling.

## Underdefined (blue) sketch geometry left unconstrained mid-workflow is fragile (2026-09-20)

Several sources routinely rough in a sketch shape first (an arbitrary, unconstrained dovetail or
joint profile, shown blue) and only constrain it fully afterward, sometimes several steps later.
This is fine as a demonstration pace but leaves a real window where the geometry can be
accidentally dragged out of place before it's constrained -- fully constrain a sketch (or at least
lock down anything that later features will depend on) before moving on to the next feature in a
real project, rather than leaving it for "later."

## Renaming/labeling mistakes increase the risk of operating on the wrong part in a cluttered tree (2026-09-20)

At least one source mislabels a component (a "small drawer side left" that was actually the right
side) and catches it only later; the same source separately notes needing to rename things
"because the convention was getting a bit messy." In a tree with many visually-similar copied/
mirrored parts (which is the norm in furniture modeling -- lots of near-identical panels and
drawer parts), a lazy or inconsistent naming convention meaningfully raises the odds of selecting
the wrong part for a Combine, Joint, or pattern operation. Name parts accurately and consistently
as they're created, not retroactively once the tree already feels cluttered.

## Sketch snapping silently fails without "Auto Project Edges on Reference" enabled (2026-09-20)

At least 14 independent commenters across four different videos hit the exact same symptom:
starting a sketch near existing geometry gives no snap/inference cue on nearby vertices or
midpoints. The cause is a Preferences setting (General > Design > "Auto Project Edges on
Reference," worded slightly differently across versions) that is not enabled by default in the
versions these videos were made on. Check this setting before assuming a snapping failure means
something is wrong with the geometry itself.

## Recreating or replacing a component can silently orphan a sketch elsewhere in the model (2026-09-20)

Confirmed independently by 5+ commenters across two different lessons: rebuilding or replacing one
component (e.g. splitting a merged part into separate real components, per patterns.md #85) can
break a *different* sketch elsewhere that used the original component's face as its sketch plane --
the affected sketch shows a yellow warning and its downstream part silently stops tracking its
driving parameter. Fix: right-click the broken sketch > "Redefine sketch plane," re-pick the
correct current face. This is the general form of the construction-plane-deletion gotcha already
documented -- any component recreation/replacement, not only deleting a construction plane, can
orphan a reference somewhere else in the tree, and the breakage doesn't show up at the point where
the change was made.

## Mirror/Pattern instances remain geometrically linked to their source, with no built-in "make unique" (2026-09-20)

An edit or joinery cut applied to one Mirror or Pattern instance applies to every instance sharing
that source, because they remain genuinely linked geometry, not independent copies -- this is a
modeling constraint, not just the already-documented BOM-counting quirk. If two parts only *look*
symmetric but actually need independent asymmetric details (an offset dado, an off-center hole),
Mirror/Pattern is the wrong tool. The reported workaround, "Paste New" to decouple a copy from its
source, only works cleanly if done before any other feature references the shared geometry --
retrofitting independence later is reported as painful. Decide whether two parts are genuinely
symmetric before choosing Mirror/Pattern over modeling them separately.

## Rectangular Pattern's "Start Point" field can silently default to a stray non-zero value (2026-09-20)

Reported cause of a pattern's last instance landing out of alignment by roughly half a stock
thickness: the pattern dialog's Start Point field defaulting to something like 0.004 instead of a
clean 0.00. Check/reset this field to 0 explicitly rather than assuming it starts there. Separately,
the pattern dialog's "Suppression" option must be enabled to get per-instance checkboxes for
deselecting individual copies -- more than one commenter got stuck looking for this.

## Component Appearance/grain is shared across every instance of the same component definition (2026-09-20)

Changing the wood-grain Appearance on one instance of a repeated component (e.g. one copy of a
duplicated drawer sub-assembly) changes it on every other instance sharing that component
definition at once, the same way assigning Physical Material to a shared/copied component affects
every instance (patterns.md #93) -- because instances of the same component definition share it.
To vary grain/appearance per-instance, the instance needs to be made a unique component first (see
the Mirror/Pattern-linkage gotcha above for why that's not always straightforward to do after the
fact).

## Reorganizing the component browser tree can silently break existing joints (2026-09-20)

One reported case: moving components into new folders/sub-assembly groupings after Joints (see
patterns.md #91) were already set up caused drawer sliding joints to stop functioning, with no
obvious error pointing at the reorganization as the cause. Treat tree reorganization as a
non-trivial operation once joints exist, and verify joint/animation behavior afterward rather than
assuming a pure organizational change is safe.

## A regenerated parts table can silently drop the "(Mirror)" suffix from a mirrored component's description (2026-09-20)

One reported case: after editing an exploded view and regenerating the drawing's parts table, a
mirrored component's description lost its "(Mirror)" marker -- a concrete new failure mode on top
of the already-documented mirrored-component BOM fragmentation (gotchas.md, mirrored components
fragment BOM/quantity counts). Re-check mirrored-part descriptions in a parts table after any
regeneration, not just after the initial generation.

## Fusion does not deduplicate independently-modeled parts that happen to match in a parts table (2026-09-20)

Matching dimensions and material alone does not make Fusion treat two separately-built components
as "the same part" for BOM/quantity-counting purposes -- correct quantity counting requires true
copies or patterns descended from one source component, not parts that were separately modeled to
the same spec. Combined with the cut-list-values-aren't-live-linked gotcha below, this means a
generated parts list needs real scrutiny, not a glance, before it's trusted for shop use.

## Cut-list/BOM dimension values are not live-linked to the model -- confirmed independently by multiple viewers (2026-09-20)

The standard workaround reported across more than one video: manually measure each part with
Inspect and type the value into the component's name/description by hand. This is redundant,
error-prone, and -- because it's manual -- has to be redone after every parameter change, since
nothing flags a now-stale typed value as wrong. This directly reinforces and sharpens the
already-documented "manually-entered part metadata does not auto-update on resize" gotcha: it's not
just that metadata can go stale, it's that there is no available live-linked alternative in the
base tool for cut-list dimensions specifically, so a generated cut list needs a full manual
re-verification pass before it goes to the shop, every time.

## Exploded views require true components, not bodies or ad-hoc copies (2026-09-20)

Auto Explode and manual exploding (Animation workspace, patterns.md #92) only work on real
components -- a design still using undivided bodies can't be exploded until it's actually split into
components. Separately, a plain "copy" of a component (as opposed to a real pattern/mirror instance)
only shows the original in an exploded view, not the copy -- another reason (beyond BOM counting) to
prefer genuine component instances over manually duplicated geometry for anything that will need an
exploded view or a drawing.

## Fusion drawings only place accurate dimensions on orthographic views, not isometric/exploded views (2026-09-20)

A well-corroborated, long-standing limitation per the reviewed comments: dimensions added to an
isometric or exploded drawing view read incorrectly, and only top/front/side (orthographic)
views support correct dimensioning. Plan a drawing sheet's dimensioned views as orthographic from
the start; use an isometric/exploded view for visual clarity only, never for a dimension a builder
will actually cut to.

## Personal/hobbyist license has real export and workflow limits since a 2020 tier change (2026-09-20)

Repeatedly confirmed across 5+ videos' comments: the free hobbyist tier no longer exports
multi-sheet drawings, PDF, DXF, STEP, IGES, or SAT; cloud rendering and "Quick Add" to drawing
sheets are gone; active documents are capped at 10. Reported workarounds: OS-level "print to PDF"
(reliable on Mac) or a screenshot tool for getting a drawing sheet to PDF, and creating new drawing
sheets manually instead of via the removed Quick Add. Worth checking Fusion's current licensing
terms directly before planning a workflow that assumes any of these are available on a free account.

## A hobbyist license can be revoked if the account is used to design items that are then sold (2026-09-20)

Multiple commenters warn that Autodesk can remotely revoke a personal/hobbyist license's file
access if it determines designs made under it are being sold. If a project is ever likely to be
sold rather than kept personal, the reported fix is switching to the free small-business license
tier (reported approval turnaround: about a day) rather than risking the hobbyist account.

## Join-mode extrude merges with ANY touching/connected body, not just the one intended (2026-09-20)

An experienced-user comment reinforces and sharpens the already-documented Extrude-defaults-to-Join
gotcha: Join doesn't merge only with the specific face/edge that was meant to be extended -- it
merges with any body it happens to touch or connect to, which can silently pull in an unrelated
part. Also reported: Extrude frequently defaults to the *negative* direction, requiring a manual
sign flip to get the intended direction; and a component's local X/Y/Z axes often don't point the
way a modeler expects when picking an axis for a Joint (reinforcing the already-documented
trial-and-error joint-axis gotcha) -- check the local axis orientation explicitly rather than
assuming it matches the world axes.

## A part-design-mode project always merges new geometry into one body regardless of the Join/Cut/New Body choice (2026-09-20)

One commenter flags a project-level setting trap: unless a project/document is started in
"hybrid" mode, standard "part design" mode will merge all new extruded geometry into a single body
no matter what's selected in the Extrude operation dropdown. If separate bodies/components aren't
resulting despite explicitly choosing New Body/New Component, check which design mode the document
is in before troubleshooting the individual feature.

## A spline's Equal constraint only equalizes control-line lengths, not their angle -- can silently break sweep symmetry (2026-09-20)

Reported cause of a swept profile (e.g. crown moulding) that visually "stops halfway" or shows a
discontinuity at its centerline: the Equal constraint used to make two halves of a profile spline
match only equalizes their line lengths, not the angle each makes, so the result can be subtly
asymmetric even though it looks constrained/correct in the sketch. Reported workaround: draw one
half of the profile, trim it to the centerline, then Mirror it, rather than relying on Equal alone
for a symmetric sweep profile.

## A bounding box on a swept/curved body measures along the curve, not the straight-line span (2026-09-20)

A reported case: a swept crown-moulding body's bounding-box length read far larger than the actual
straight-line span of the piece it was mounted to. Suspected cause: the bounding box follows the
curved sweep path rather than measuring the linear extent. Don't trust a bounding-box dimension at
face value on any swept or otherwise curved body -- verify against a known reference dimension
first, consistent with the general "bounding box sanity check" habit in patterns.md #12.

## Rectangular-patterned instances stay linked as one feature -- a single instance can't be edited or removed independently (2026-09-20)

Reported for a row of pattern-generated wall studs: trying to edit one instance (e.g. to cut a
window opening in one stud) or delete a single instance affects the whole pattern feature at once,
with no obvious way to break one instance out on its own. If an individual instance in a pattern
will eventually need independent treatment, plan for that before patterning (e.g. exclude that
position from the pattern and model it separately from the start) rather than expecting to peel one
out later.

## A missing Coincident constraint, not just a hardcoded literal, is a confirmed real cause of "resizing breaks the model" (2026-09-20)

A commenter diagnosed a specific case of a parametric model breaking on resize (a top panel that
stopped tracking an overall height parameter) back to a sketch edge that was never actually made
Coincident with the panel it needed to track, even though the two looked aligned in the sketch. This
is a concrete, diagnosed instance of the general "Fusion doesn't auto-weld touching geometry"
gotcha already documented (patterns.md #84) -- when a resize breaks something that looks like it
should have tracked correctly, check for a missing Coincident constraint before assuming the
formula/parameter itself is wrong.

## Fusion's default up-axis convention has changed over time (X-up to Z-up) (2026-09-20)

One commenter notes Fusion's default up-axis has changed since some of these (several-years-old)
tutorials were made, now defaulting to Z-up (the current industry-standard default) rather than
X-up. A model built by following an older tutorial's on-screen axis orientation may not match a
current install's default -- the convention is changeable in Preferences if a specific orientation
is needed to match older material.
